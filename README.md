## Project presentation

**The goal of the NARPS Open Pipelines project is to create a codebase reproducing the 70 pipelines of the NARPS project (Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020) and share this as an open resource for the community**. 

We base our reproductions on the [original descriptions provided by the teams](https://github.com/poldrack/narps/blob/1.0.1/ImageAnalyses/metadata_files/analysis_pipelines_for_analysis.xlsx) and test the quality of the reproductions by comparing our results with the original results published on NeuroVault.

:vertical_traffic_light: See [the pipeline dashboard](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/wiki/pipeline_status) to view our current progress at a glance.

## Contributing

NARPS open pipelines uses nipype as a workflow manager and provides a series of templates and examples to help reproduce the different teamsâ€™ analysis. 

There are many ways you can contribute ðŸ¤— :wave: Any help is welcome ! Follow the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you wish to get involved !

### Installation

To get the pipelines running, please follow the installation steps in [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md)

## Getting started
If you are interested in using the codebase to run the pipelines, see the [user documentation].
