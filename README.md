**The goal of the NARPS Open Pipelines project is to create a codebase reproducing the 70 pipelines of the NARPS study (Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020) and share this as an open resource for the community**. 

We base our reproductions on the original descriptions provided by the teams and test the quality of the reproductions by comparing our results with the original results published on NeuroVault.

Find more information about the NARPS study [here](docs/narps.md).

:vertical_traffic_light: See [the pipeline dashboard](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/wiki/pipeline_status) to view our current progress at a glance !

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute ðŸ¤— :wave: Any help is welcome ! 

NARPS Open Pipelines uses [nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as a workflow manager and provides a series of templates and examples to help reproducing the different teamsâ€™ analyses. Nevertheless knowing Python or Nipype is not required to take part in the project.

Follow the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you wish to get involved !

## Using the codebase

To get the pipelines running, please follow the installation steps in [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md).

If you are interested in using the codebase, see the user documentation in [docs](/docs/) (work-in-progress).
