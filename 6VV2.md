# NARPS team description : 6VV2
## General
* `teamID` : 6VV2
* `NV_collection_link` : https://neurovault.org/collections/4883/
* `results_comments` : NA
* `preregistered` : No
* `link_preregistration_form` : NA
* `regions_definition` : We used Neurosynth and did a term search for each of the brain regions. We identified the peak z-score in the left and right hemisphere for the ventral striatum and amygdala and extracted the coordinates. For the vmPFC we also identified the two largest z-scores (one more anterior and one more posterior) and extracted the coordinates of those peaks. Using those coordinates, we created a 5mm sphere around each of the six coordinates we had identified. Our criteria for whether an effect was found in a region was that our thresholded contrast maps had to cover 25% of the combined volume of the two sphere ROIs for each region. The MNI coordinates for the center of each ROI sphere are listed below:
Left Ventral Striatum: -10, 10, -6
Right Ventral Striatum: 10, 10, -8
Left Amygdala: -24, -2, -20
Right Amygdala: 22, -4, -18
Anterior vmPFC: 0, 58, -6
Posterior vmPFC: 0, 46, -8
* `softwares` : AFNI Version 19.0.01 Tiberius
* `general_comments` : When uploading to Neurovault, there are no regions appearing in the thresholded map for hypothesis 1 or 3. However, there are a few significant clusters in the parietal cortex when we look at the same files in the AFNI viewer. These clusters do not have any bearing on our evaluation of the requested hypotheses. We are not sure what is causing the discrepancy, but we would be happy to provide the exact .nii files if they would be helpful. We did download the problematic .nii file directly from Neurovault and those clusters are evident looking at that file in the AFNI viewer. It seems like the file is fine, but there is some issue with displaying the contents of the file in Neurovault. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do.
## Exclusions
* `n_participants` : 101
* `exclusions_details` : sub-016, sub-018, sub-030, sub-088, sub-089, and sub-100 were excluded for motion (details in preprocessing explanation). Participants were excluded from the analysis if any of the four functional runs required censoring > 25% of TRs based on our pre-determined motion censoring thresholds (see preprocessing details). Sub-072 was excluded due to registration problems (scans appeared to be acquired in a different orientation and our preprocessing pipeline had problems aligning and transforming these scans into standard space). The same issue was observed in sub-089 who had already been excluded due to motion.
## Preprocessing
* `used_fmriprep_data` : No 
* `preprocessing_order` : Data were processed with AFNI's proc.py pipeline. The processing steps we selected were: despike, tshift, align, tlrc, volreg, blur, mask, scale, regress.
* `brain_extraction` : NA
* `segmentation` : NA
* `slice_time_correction` : AFNI's tshift processing block in the proc.py pipeline was used with default parameters. This pipeline performs slice time correction prior to motion correction. Interpolation information is as follows: Used the quintic (5th order) Lagrange polynomial interpolation. Each slice was aligned to a time offset of 0.
* `motion_correction` : AFNI's volreg software was used through the proc.py pipeline. We used a 6 parameter rigid body transformation. The reference scan was identified as the volume with the smallest outlier fraction (option -volreg_align_to_MIN_OUTLIER). The image similarity metric used by volreg is an iterated linearized weighted least squares algorithm. Cubic interpolation was used.
* `motion` : 
* `gradient_distortion_correction` : NA
* `intra_subject_coreg` : Function to structure coregistration was completed within the afni_proc.py pipeline. The type of transformation was a linear affine. The cost function we selected was "lpc+ZZ." This cost function begins with local Pearson correlations plus fractions of other cost functions and finishes with pure local Pearson correlation. The interpolation mode used to create the output dataset was cubic.
* `distortion_correction` : NA
* `inter_subject_reg` : Intersubject registration was again completed with the afni_proc.py pipeline. We registered volume data from the T1 scans. We used the "MNI152_T1_2009c" template included with AFNI distributions. The choice of warp was the default warp used by the AFNI 3dQwarp command called by the "-tlrc_NL_warp" option in the afni_proc.py pipeline.
* `intensity_correction` : NA
* `intensity_normalization` : Intensity normalization was completed with the scale processing block in the afni_proc.py pipeline. Each run mean was scaled to 100 for each voxel with a maximum value of 200.
* `noise_removal` : Artifact and structured noise removal was completed with the afni_proc.py pipeline. Demeaned motion parameters and the 1st temporal derivatives were used.
* `volume_censoring` : We used the despike processing block in the afni_proc.py pipeline. This used the default setting for AFNI's 3dDespike command. The first 3 volumes of each functional scan were also removed using the "-regress_censor_first_trs" option. Finally, we used the "-regress_censor_motion" option to identify TRs with a Euclidean norm value greater than 0.2 for censoring. The TR prior to flagged TRs is also censored. No interpolation was used as AFNI removes censored TRs from the regression model.
* `spatial_smoothing` : Spatial smoothing was conducted using the blur processing block in the afni_proc.py pipeline. A 4mm FWHM gaussian blur was used. Smoothing was only done in a mask of the entire brain volume (-blur_in automask option). This approach uses an iterative smoothing process until the data reaches the specified smoothness. Spatial smoothing is performed in MNI space.

## Analysis
* `data_submitted_to_model` : This information is already specified in other portions of this form.
* `spatial_region_modeled` : Full brain. Decisions regarding hypotheses were based on anatomical regions defined in other portions of this form.
* `independent_vars_first_level` : All trials were modelled. The duration modelled was 4 seconds. We used parametric modulation with the gain and loss values for each trial (-regress_stim_times AM2 option is afni_proc.py pipeline). We used a canonical only HRF. We used the default AFNI canonical HRF which is a gamma variate function. Motion regressors were demeaned and we used the six motion parameters as well as their temporal derivatives. Baseline was modelled with a 4th degree polynomial as recommended by the AFNI 3dDeconvolve command.
* `RT_modeling` : none
* `movement_modeling` : 1
* `independent_vars_higher_level` : Group effects were between the equal indifference and the equal range groups. Factor in the group model consisted of group membership (between) and the amplitude modulation beta values for gains and losses (within).
* `model_type` : We used a linear mixed effects model with the AFNI 3dLME program.
* `model_settings` : We used a linear mixed effect model with the AFNI program 3dLME.

* `inference_contrast_effect` : Using AFNI's 3dLME we requested general linear tests to evaluate the hypotheses. These included: Gains for the equal indifference group, Losses for the equal indifference group, Gains for the equal range group, Losses for the equal range group, and the group effect (equal indifference vs equal range) restricted to the loss condition. All statistical tests were two-sided.
* `search_region` : Whole brain. Evaluation of the hypotheses in regard to anatomical regions is discussed in other portions of this form.
* `statistic_type` : Cluster size. Minimum cluster size was 12 voxels. Voxels clustered together if faces or edges were touching (AFNI option -NN2).
* `pval_computation` : Standard parametric inference.
* `multiple_testing_correction` : We used AFNI's 3dClustSim function to perform a FWE random field correction. As currently suggested, we included an estimate of the noise structure with a spatial autocorrelation function. These noise structure estimates were used to estimate the random field model. A voxel-wise threshold of uncorrected p<0.001 for two-tailed tests was used to determine the minimum cluster size threshold.

The ACF values (mean across subjects) used in this step were: 0.674273, 2.12155, 3.7347 
* `comments_analysis` : One thing our team found strange was that the results were all corrected for whole brain analyses when there were very specific a priori hypotheses about regions of interest. Also, some of our scores regarding the similarity to other groups' results were influenced by looking at unthresholded data and observing that different ROI definitions or criteria would have potentially changed our answer for the hypothesis. We collectively discussed and made decisions about our ROI definition and how we would evaluate the hypotheses prior to data analysis. We did not alter the criteria we decided upon, but when looking at the results it was clear that it would have been possible to reach different conclusions had we made different choices about ROI definition and the exact criteria we used to evaluate the hypotheses.
