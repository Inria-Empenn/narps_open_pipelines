We realized this decision was an oversight on our part after we examined the group-level results, which primarily contained motor and visual activation for the primary contrasts of interests. Upon seeing those results, we updated our model to the one described below. In our view, our final model reflects a balance between the Tom et al and Canessa et al papers.
In addition, we also would like to provide some context for our confidence ratings in the table above. We primarily gave high confidence ratings in cases where we felt the results were unambiguous in terms of spatial location and significance threshold. We provided a low confidence rating for H3 because our suprathreshold results are just posterior to the nucleus accumbens (i.e., the globus pallidus) and we suspect some teams will find a very similar results and label it ""ventral striatum"", which is justifiable in our view (but it is not how we dedided to define the region at the outset, as described below). In other cases where we have medium confidence levels and we did not confirm the hypotheses, our uncertainty stems, in part, from how decision difficulty was modeled and also from the threshold since we can see some hints of activation just below 0.05 FWE."	No	NA	We used the Harvard-Oxford probabilistic atlas to determine whether the predicted effects were in the appropriate regions. We defined VMPFC using a definition described in previous work [Supplementary Note 1 for Delgado et al. (2016). Nature Neuroscience, 19(12), 1545-1552]. We defined ventral striatum as both the left and right nucleus accumbens (maxprob > 25%). Finally, we defined the amygdala as both the left and right amygdala (maxprob > 25%).

"According the FMRIPrep output, the T1w-reference was skull-stripped using antsBrainExtraction.sh (ANTs 2.2.0), using OASIS as target template. Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, RRID:SCR_001847, Dale, Fischl, and Sereno 1999), and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray-matter of Mindboggle (RRID:SCR_002438, Klein et al. 2017).
The functional images were skull-stripped using the default settings in FSL 5.0. To the best of our knowledge, the default approach within FSL integrates BET (fractional intensity threshold = 0.3) with a thresholding procedure that distinguishes the brain voxels from the background voxels based on their the intensity distributions. Voxels whose intensity is less than 10% of the distribution of values across the entire volume are masked from further analyses."	Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001).	We did not use slice time correction.	According to the output report of FMRIPrep, the following motion correction procedures were applied to the data. For each of the 4 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on a field map that was co-registered to the BOLD reference, using a custom workflow of fMRIPrep derived from D. Greve’s epidewarp.fsl script and further improvements of HCP Pipelines (Glasser et al. 2013). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002).	6	Based on our understanding of the FMRIPrep output, gradient distortion correction was included during the motion correction step.	We used FMRIPrep for function-structure coregistration. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. 	This procedure was performed as part of the motion correction (see above).	Inter-subject co-registration was performed via fmriprep. Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage5. The BOLD time-series were resampled to MNI152NLin2009cAsym standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space 	"According to fmriprep output, the T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) using N4BiasFieldCorrection (Tustison et al. 2010, ANTs 2.2.0), and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
As far as we know, FMRIPrep does not mention an intensity correction for odd versus even slices intensity differences attributable to interleaved EPI acquistions without gaps."	Intensity normalization was carried out using FSL’s FEAT tool. Grand-Mean normalisation of the entire 4D dataset used as single multiplicative factor.	To minimize the residual effects of head motion, we used ICA-AROMA. Our implementation of ICA-AROMA used the default settings within the program. Input data for ICA-AROMA was smoothed by 6mm (consistent with the recommendation from the developers and the implementation within FMRIPREP).	We did not use any volume censoring in our analysis.	Spatial smoothing was applied using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 4.0mm and carried out using FSL’s FEAT.	We performed ICA-AROMA outside of FMRIPrep, and it is unclear to us whether this procedure could affect the results with MB data. If we understand correctly, the FMRIPrep implementation of ICA-AROMA discards NonSteadyState volumes prior to running Melodic.	Exclusions already specified. Each run image submitted to analysis had 452 volumes.	Full brain.	"The final model used for inference had 5 regressors of interest.

In addition, we also included regressors for Missed trials. Non-steady state volumes, as identified by fmriprep, were also included as nuisance regressors."	onset	0	"Second-level Analysis: Run-level contrast of parameter estimates from the first level analyses serve as the dependent variable for the 2nd level analyses. This model utlized a fixed effects model and essentially averaged responses across runs within each subject.

Group-level: We utlized two group-level models. The first model was a single-group average, which was ran for both EQI and EQR groups; this model used a single regressor. The second model was a two-group t-test, where group type (equal-range vs equal indifference) were modeled as factors."	We applied a Mass Univariate model. 	"Our first-level model utlized FILM, which included a locally regularized autocorrelation correction, as implemented in FSL. 

A fixed effects model was used in the lower-level models while a weighted-least squares mixed-effects model was used for the group-level models. Thus, the unthresholded z-stat images in our collection were derived from FSL's FLAME 1 output.

For group comparisons (i.e., Hypothesis 9), our model assumed equal variance between groups. "	Seven contrasts were considered, one the positive effect of gains for each group (2), one for the negative and positive effect of loss for each group (4), and one for the group contrast. The positive and negative effects of loss were conducted via two one-sided tests. 	The search region was over the entire brain.	Threshold free cluster enhancement was the statistic used for the final inference. We used default settings for TFCE.	We used permutation testing in combination with tfce to compute p-values. We used 10,000 permutations to reduce uncertainty <1% at the p=0.05 level.	We used permutation testing in combination with tfce to compute p-values. 10,000 permutations to reduce uncertainty <1% at the p=0.05 level. 	Given the number of group-level hypotheses, we considered applying an additional Bonferroni correction, but we felt this could be too stringent since the tests are not completely independent. To address this issue in future studies in our lab, we are considering PALM. But, since that is not something we've implemented to date, we elected to go with procedures and practices that we currently adop.	We appreciate the opportunity to work on this project, and we are excited to see similiarities and differences across teams. We suspect that one major source of variability will be how teams chose to model the lower level data since this was, in our view, one of the major differences between Tom et al and Canessa et al.

Anatomical data preprocessing
The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) using N4BiasFieldCorrection (Tustison et al. 2010, ANTs 2.2.0), and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped using antsBrainExtraction.sh (ANTs 2.2.0), using OASIS as target template.

Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001).
Functional data preprocessing
For each of the 4 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on a field map that was co-registered to the BOLD reference, using a custom workflow of fMRIPrep derived from D. Greve’s epidewarp.fsl script and further improvements of HCP Pipelines (Glasser et al. 2013). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002). The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage5. The BOLD time-series were resampled to MNI152NLin2009cAsym standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al. 2014). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, Behzadi et al. 2007). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). Six tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, six components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and template spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos 1964). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).

Specifically, the bilateral amygdala was defined based on the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Atlas, the bilateral ventral striatum was defined based on the Oxford-Imanova Striatal Structural Atlas, and the vmPFC was defined based on the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Atlas, specifically the Frontal Medial Cortex. Structures contained in the Harvard-Oxford Atlas were initially probabilisitc masks, which we thresholded at 50% before deciding on whether the predicted effects were found in amygdala and/or vmPFC.	nistats (version 0.0.1a)	102	In addition to the participants excluded by the NARPS team based on behavoral criteria, we excluded a further 6 participants completely: sub-016, sub-018, sub-030, sub-088, sub-100, sub-116.

For effect of loss: Loss against 0
Please note: The modulatory effects of gains and losses should reflect activation differences that account for variance beyond variance explained by the intercept (i.e. response times).
For the comparison of the effect of loss in the two payoff conditions (i.e. equal range and equal indifference groups), we did not find a significant difference between the two groups. The absence of a difference was driven by the absence of main effects in both groups for losses. We are happy to provide further details if required."	All individual and group analyses were computed and corrected for multiple testing at the level of the whole brain. We used ROI masks (see above) to assess whether any of the voxels with significant activation differences above the correction threshold fell inside the regions specified by the hypotheses.	Voxel-wise inference 	Standard parametric inference to compute P-values	Benjamini & Hochberg FDR (p<.05) at voxel / peak level  	For full disclosure: For both the equal range and the equal indifference groups, we inspected the group-level statistical parametric map for the intercept we created; concretely, this intercept comes from placing a boxcar function on the onset of every event (i.e. gamble) extending over the trial by the response time (i.e., until a response was made). Despite low average correlations between the intercept and gain regressor and loss regressor (around 0.1 for both), we found activation differences in the intercept contrast (intercept against 0) which we would have expected to see in the respective gain and loss contrasts (e.g., positive effect in striatum and midbrain, and negative effect in vmPFC). This indicates to us that perhaps the design does not properly allow us to inspect gain and loss modulatory signals that are independent of this intercept (i.e. response times).	Overall, the design of the task, in particular the timing and presentation format, leave us in a position of diminished confidence in our results. Specifically, the design employs a decision-making paradigm, with a fixed duration of 4 seconds from the onset of the decision options (i.e. gamble) until the offset, during which individuals not only see a particular gamble but also have to make a choice between 4 possible response options. We believe that there is a (complex) decision-making process underlying this task, including various cognitive processes such as valuation, motor preparation, and a graded choice. Individuals also have a time limit so there may be added pressure to make a selection. Overall, we are not confident that such a design lends itself very well to the estimation of the modulating effects of gains and losses because we suspect gains, losses, expected value, choices and response times to be at least moderately correlated and thus hard to be disentangled. One possibility is to follow the approach by Tom et al. (2007, Science), who modelled the neural effects of gains, losses and choice difficulty (Euclidean distance of a particular gamble from diagnonal in the payoff matrix). However, this runs the risk of ascribing signal variance to gains and losses that is actually choice-related. Yet, separating out these neural signals, is not feasible given the temporal design of the task. Thus, we set up a design matrix similar to the one used by Tom et al. (2007, Science), which ignores the choice component. Although we attempted to control for response times and the decision process by employing a boxcar HRF convolution, we are still not confident about the ability of the design to discriminate between valuation and decision processes, and thus deliver a signal reflective only of the parametric effect of losses and gains. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to be part of this project!

For each of the 4 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on a field map that was co-registered to the BOLD reference, using a custom workflow of fMRIPrep derived from D. Greve’s epidewarp.fsl script and further improvements of HCP Pipelines (Glasser et al. 2013). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. Headmotion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002). The BOLD timeseries (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: fsaverage5. The BOLD time-series were resampled to MNI152NLin2009cAsym standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by Power et al. 2014). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, Behzadi et al. 2007). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and
anatomical (aCompCor). Six tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5%
variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is
obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, six components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and coregistrations to anatomical and template spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (Lanczos 1964). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).

Each slice was aligned to a time offset of 0.	AFNI's volreg software was used through the proc.py pipeline. We used a 6 parameter rigid body transformation. The reference scan was identified as the volume with the smallest outlier fraction (option -volreg_align_to_MIN_OUTLIER). The image similarity metric used by volreg is an iterated linearized weighted least squares algorithm. Cubic interpolation was used.		NA	"Function to structure coregistration was completed within the afni_proc.py pipeline. The type of transformation was a linear affine. The cost function we selected was ""lpc+ZZ."" This cost function begins with local Pearson correlations plus fractions of other cost functions and finishes with pure local Pearson correlation. The interpolation mode used to create the output dataset was cubic."	NA	"Intersubject registration was again completed with the afni_proc.py pipeline. We registered volume data from the T1 scans. We used the ""MNI152_T1_2009c"" template included with AFNI distributions. The choice of warp was the default warp used by the AFNI 3dQwarp command called by the ""-tlrc_NL_warp"" option in the afni_proc.py pipeline."	NA	Intensity normalization was completed with the scale processing block in the afni_proc.py pipeline. Each run mean was scaled to 100 for each voxel with a maximum value of 200.	Artifact and structured noise removal was completed with the afni_proc.py pipeline. Demeaned motion parameters and the 1st temporal derivatives were used.	"We used the despike processing block in the afni_proc.py pipeline. This used the default setting for AFNI's 3dDespike command. The first 3 volumes of each functional scan were also removed using the ""-regress_censor_first_trs"" option. Finally, we used the ""-regress_censor_motion"" option to identify TRs with a Euclidean norm value greater than 0.2 for censoring. The TR prior to flagged TRs is also censored. No interpolation was used as AFNI removes censored TRs from the regression model."	Spatial smoothing was conducted using the blur processing block in the afni_proc.py pipeline. A 4mm FWHM gaussian blur was used. Smoothing was only done in a mask of the entire brain volume (-blur_in automask option). This approach uses an iterative smoothing process until the data reaches the specified smoothness. Spatial smoothing is performed in MNI space.

Also, some of our scores regarding the similarity to other groups' results were influenced by looking at unthresholded data and observing that different ROI definitions or criteria would have potentially changed our answer for the hypothesis. We collectively discussed and made decisions about our ROI definition and how we would evaluate the hypotheses prior to data analysis. We did not alter the criteria we decided upon, but when looking at the results it was clear that it would have been possible to reach different conclusions had we made different choices about ROI definition and the exact criteria we used to evaluate the hypotheses. 	When uploading to Neurovault, there are no regions appearing in the thresholded map for hypothesis 1 or 3. However, there are a few significant clusters in the parietal cortex when we look at the same files in the AFNI viewer. These clusters do not have any bearing on our evaluation of the requested hypotheses. We are not sure what is causing the discrepancy, but we would be happy to provide the exact .nii files if they would be helpful. We did download the problematic .nii file directly from Neurovault and those clusters are evident looking at that file in the AFNI viewer. It seems like the file is fine, but there is some issue with displaying the contents of the file in Neurovault.

Independent variables at the first level (i.e. intra-subject) were analyzed using an event-related design approach.  A parametric modulation approach was used in analyzing the data.  This resulted in 3 explanatory variables (EVs). Each EV had 3 columns: onset, duration, weight. The response time for each trial was used as the duration. Trials that had a response time of 0 were not included in the model. The first EV consisted of all trials within a given run with a weight of 1 .  The second EV consisted of all trials categorized as a ""gain"" trial; the third EV consisted of all trials categorized as a ""loss"" trial. Different approaches for classifying trials as ""gain"" or ""loss"" were taken for the two different groups. For the Equal Indifference (EI) group, a cutoff score of x ≤ 1.93 was applied to the ratio between the amount to be gained or lost. If the ratio fell at or below 1.93, the trial was classified as a ""loss"". If the ratio fell above 1.93, the trial was classified as a ""gain"". For the Equal Range (ER) group, the amount that could be lost was subtracted from the amount that could be gained. If this difference was greater than 0, the trial was categorized as a ""gain"", whereas if the difference was less than 0, the trial was categorized as a ""loss"". The weights for EV2 (""gain"") and EV3 (""loss"") trials ranged from 1-16 (number of different loss/gain amount options per trial) and increased incrementally. For the ER group, this resulted in taking the amount for that category (i.e. loss trial amount for the loss category) and subtracting 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 5, which is the lowest amount to be lost, the weight would be 1). For the EI group, the corresponding trial amount was first divided by 2 and then reduced by 4 (i.e. if loss amount was 40, the weight would be 16).

Double-gamma HRF convolution was used. For each EV, the temporal derivative and temporal filtering was applied.

PCA components whose model yielded correlation coefficient above 65% were considered as nuisance regressors in the first-level analysis. Overall, this analysis returned between 5 and 15 nuissance regressors for each run. Typically, higher number of nuissance regressors was linked to higher mean framewise displacement.

7 - Generation of nuisance regressors for 1st level analysis, including motion scrubbing regressor defined using framewise displacement, and two tissue signal regressors (white matter and cerebrospinal fluid) derived from averaging the voxel values found within the segmentaed tissue maps."	No explicit brain extraction was performed, implicit masking was done during single subject statistical analysis in SPM12. 	Segmentation into (amongst other tissue types) grey matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was carried out using SPM12's unified segmentation procedure, which estimates a nonlinear deformation field that best overlays SPM12-supplied tissue probability maps onto per-subject T1w images. This segmentation process also implicitly executes bias correction and normalises the coregistered structural image to the standard MNI space, generating forward and inverse transformations. Segmentation was executed on the structural (T1w) image per subject, after coregistration to the functional space (using the first functional run's reference image as the template).	Slice time correction was not performed.	Motion correction was done with SPM12's realign (estimate and reslice) function, which uses a least squares approach and 6 degree of freedom rigid body transformation to realign each image in a time series (run) to the first image specified. For this data, 4 runs (i.e. sessions) were completed per subject, with each run being preceded by a reference scan ('sbref'). The first image for each run (i.e. the realignment template) was specified to be the relevant reference scan. For a multi-session motion correction procedure, SPM12 first realigned the first images of all sessions to the first image of the first session, and after this standard motion correction was applied per run. A two-pass procedure was executed where estimation of realignment parameters was first done with reference to the first image, and secondly with reference to the mean image of the run. For estimation, data were sampled with a 2nd degree B-spline interpolation. For reslicing, data were sampled with a 4th degree B-spline interpolation.		Gradient distortion correction was not done.	Structural to functional coregistration was executed with SPM12's coregister (estimate and reslice) function, which used normalised mutual information as the obective function to estimate transformation parameters. A 12 degree of freedom affine transformation is subsequently applied to the structural (T1w) image in order to map it to the functional space. 	Distortion correction (via supplied field maps) was not done.	Intersubject registration was conducted on contrast maps that were output from 1st level statistical analysis. SPM12's normalise (write) function was used to transform these contrast maps from native subject space into 2mm isotropic MNI space (using the MNI template supplied with SPM12). This function required a forward transformation field, which was output from SPM12's unified segmentation step as a field mapping between subject native space and MNI space (see segmentation explanantion above). The normalise (write) process performed interpolation using a 4th degree B-spline. Further SPM12 defaults for normalise (write) and the unified segmentation step (including warping and regularisation parameters) were kept as is.	Bias field correction was done as part of SPM12's unified segmentation procedure (as described above) using default settings (light regularisation and 60mm cutoff for bias FWHM). 	The default intensity normalisation procedure of SPM12 was used. 	Further artefact removal was conducted using SPM12 and self-developed Matlab scripts. The method involved defining multiple regressors to be included in the GLM design matrix of the subject-specific 1st level analyses, in order to explain additional variance in the fMRI data. The 6 motion parameter timeseries resulting from the functional realignment procedure were included as regressors, with no further expansion (i.e. no derivatives or squares). Tissue signals from WM and CSF compartments were also included as regressors. For tissue signals, the results of the unified segmentation procedure were various segmented tissue maps with probability values. A self developed script was used to generate binary maps for GM, WM and CSF in the native space. This script first thresholded all separate segmentations at 0.5 (50% probability) and then compared surviving probability values for GM, WM and CSF for each within-brain voxel and assigned the voxel to the tissue with the highest probability. The space-averaged timeseries for all voxels within the resulting WM and CSF binary maps were calculated, respectively, and these were added as regressors to the GLM design matrix. 	Volume censoring was conducted using SPM12 and self-developed Matlab scripts. For each run of each subject, the 6 motion parameter timeseries resulting from the functional realignment procedure were used to calculate a framewise displacement (FD) timeseries per run. The method was adapted from Power et al. (2012), using 50mm as the assumed radius for translating rotation parameters into displacements, assuming small angle approximations. A threshold of 0.5 mm was set to define so-called 'motion outlier' volumes, which after application to the FD timeseries yielded a binary 'scrubbing' regressor per run. Scrubbing regressors' first two volumes were corrected to account for the fact that the first volume of each run was registered to a template ('sbref') and thus displayed high FD which was not the result of in-scan motion. The corrected scrubbing regressors were included as part of the GLM design matrix employed during subject-specific 1st level statistical analysis, in order to explain possible additional variance.  	Spatial smoothing was conducted on realigned functional data using SPM12's standard smoothing function, which used a fixed Gaussian smoothing kernel with FWHM of 4mm (twice the voxel size). Smoothing was performed in the native functional space.	No	All 453 time points per run were included. All 4 runs per subject were included. 1 subject (sub-030) was excluded based on exclusion criteria previously mentioned. The final subject count was 54 in the equal indifference group, and 53 in the equal range group (i.e. 107 in total). 	A full brain analysis was conducted.	"The GLM design matrix for the 1st level analysis consited of 17 explicitly specified regressors per run. Of these regressors, the first 8 related to experimental conditions, whereas the remaining 9 were nuisance regressors (6 head motion parameter regressors, 2 tissue signal regressors, and 1 scrubbing regressor), none of which were entered as interactions. For the experimental conditions, we are interested in the parametric effect of gain and of loss as related to a mixed gambles task. Trial data, indicating the amount of possible gain and the amount of possible loss, as well as trial timing, trial durations and reaction times were supplied for each run per subject. From this data a block-task regressor was derived respectively for all trials where the gamble could result in a possible gain, in a possible loss, and in a no-loss-nor-gain situation (i.e. 3 block-task regressors). In each case of the possible gain/loss regressors, 2 parametric modulation regressors were added: 1 to model the parametric size of the possible gain/loss, and 1 to model the parametric size of the reaction time. In the case of the no-loss-nor-gain block-task regressor a single extra parametric modulation regressor was added to model the parametric size of the reaction time. All parametric modulation regressors were mean centered before adding them to the design matrix for the GLM analysis, which implicitly (in SPM12) orthogonalises all parametric modulators in a series with reference to the first one. No time-modulation of conditions was included.

The canonical HRF basis (default SPM12 option) was used for convolution of the 8 conditions. SPM12 automatically also included a constant regressor in the design matrix, and filtered the data and design matrix using a discrete cosine basis set with a specified cutoff frequency of 128 Hz (default). This accounted for slow drifts in the data, and no explicit drift regressors were included in the design matrix."	pm	0	Age (mean-centered) and gender (binarised) were included as covariate regressors in the 2nd level group-analyses.	The standard mass univariate approach of SPM12 was performed.	"For 1st level analysis:
Drift was modeled as part of the discrete cosine basis set, and data and design matrix using this basis set with a specified cutoff frequency of 128 Hz (default). For serial correlation modeling, the FAST model provided in SPM12 was selected.

For 2nd level analysis:
Mixed effects implemented with OLS, as standard with SPM12, was used for the single and two-sample t-tests that were performed. For the two-sample t-test (comparing groups) measurements in both levels were assumed to be independent and having unequal variance that was globally pooled."	For the experimental conditions, we are interested in the parametric effect of gain and of loss as related to a mixed gambles task. Trial data, indicating the amount of possible gain and the amount of possible loss, as well as trial timing, trial durations and reaction times were supplied for each run per subject. From this data a block-task regressor was derived respectively for all trials where the gamble could result in a possible gain, in a possible loss, and in a no-loss-nor-gain situation (i.e. 3 block-task regressors). In each case of the possible gain/loss regressors, 2 parametric modulation regressors were added: 1 to model the parametric size of the possible gain/loss, and 1 to model the parametric size of the reaction time. In the case of the no-loss-nor-gain block-task regressor a single extra parametric modulation regressor was added to model the parametric size of the reaction time. We hypothesized that when looking at the parametric effect of GAIN in the brain, we should be interested in the parametric modulators related to the 'possible gain' condition, i.e. the parametric size of the possible gain trials, and the parametric size of the reaction time for said trials. Similarly, when looking at the parametric effect of LOSS, we should be interested in the parametric modulators related to the 'possible loss' condition, i.e. the parametric size of the possible loss trials, and the parametric size of the reaction time related to these trials. We thus had two contrasts for the 1st level analysis: the GAIN contrast which set the two GAIN parametric modulator regressors to 1 and all other GLM regressors to 0; and the LOSS contrast which set the two LOSS parametric modulator regressors to 1 and all other GLM regressors to 0. For the 2nd level group analysis, where the effect of interest was a greater positive response to LOSS in one group vs another, our two-sample t-test was run by setting the contrast [-1 1], assuming the first group was set as the equal indifference group and that the LOSS contrasts resulting from the 1st level analysis of all subjects were fed into this analysis.	Whole brain mass-univariate analysis was conducted in both cases of 1st and 2nd level analysis. Masks for regions of interest were only applied spatially after all contrasts and statistical testsing had been produced/conducted, i.e. they were overlaid onto the statistical results. Therefore, no small-volume correction was conducted.	Voxel-wise, as standard in SPM12.	Standard P-value computation was employed as per SPM12 default process.	Familywise error correction using random field theory was employed, as per SPM12 default, with a P-value of 0.05 and cluster extent threshold of 0.

1) We interpreted the gain and loss effects to be linear modulation effects of the amplitude of the BOLD response.
2) We used a new method to estimate the number of active voxels (True Discovery Proportion, TDP) within each predefined ROIs (All-Resolutions Inference, see Inference: Statisics Type) with whole-brain FWER control. 
3) Our confidence estimates are reflections of how confident we are in our conclusions, given our operationalization of the modulation effects (i.e. a linear increase/decrease based on gain/loss values)
3) The ARI method method does not use thresholded maps, it can give an estimate of the number of active voxels of any aproiri or post-hoc specified ROI's. Therefore, we can not include thresholded maps in our Neurovault collection.
4) We did not confirm any of the hypothesis given our analysis approach. We did however find activation in other areas of the brain with this method.

•	NAs: a total of 194 trials (over all participants in the original dataset, so of 27648 trials) were discarded on the basis of the participant having no response (leading to max 9% of a run of a subject being discarded [sub-003run-02]), so no entire runs were excluded on the basis of this criterium)
•	RTs: a total of 11 trials (again over all participants in the original dataset, so of 27648 trials) were discarded on the basis of being outside the 0.25-4s range (leading to a maximum of 5 % of a run of one participant being discarded [sub-061run-01], so no entire runs were excluded on the basis of this criterium)
•	Motion Scrubbing: the dvars led to regressing out a total of 3290 TR’s (over all participants in the original dataset, so of 195696 TR’s), leading to max 15% of a run of a subject being regressed out [sub-116run-03]. So no entire runs were excluded on the basis of this criterium. 
•	Exclusions on the run level: next to the above-mentioned subjects who were excluded for motion,  0 participants had more than 50% of their run missing, leading to no additional exclusions based on the combination of the above criteria.
•	Artifacts and quality control: On the basis of the Qoala-T prediction and visual quality checks, the following subjects were excluded for ghosting, ringing and movement artifacts in the structural image: sub-072, sub-100
•	Five subjects were flagged for an extra check of whether the registration worked well: sub-004, suc-124, sub-073, sub-032, sub-049; A visual check was done by two team members and it was decided that the registrations were acceptable (and B0 unwarping made it better).

We diverted from the pre-registered criteria in one place: 
Next to this, after running fsl_motion_outliers and checking the refrms output we realized that setting a threshold of 4 did not set a threshold in mm but in intensity differences. Therefore we did not use the refrms matrices, but we visually checked the displacement images for each participant and run, and excluded runs in which any of the absolute and/or relative values were larger than 4 mm. This resulted in excluding all runs for subject 030, run 3 for subject 088 and run 2 for subject 116.

One-sided t-test [-1 1] (equal indifference = group 1, equal range = group 2)

* We interpreted this final hypothesis to reflect the following: is the parametric effect of loss in the amygdala greater in the equal range than in the equal indifference group?

For the ARI method (see below) we converted z-maps to p-values using fslmaths -ztop option (one sided). Since all hypotheses are one-sided we do not need two adjust for performing multiple one-sided hypotheses to test a two-sided hypothesis. 

For the negative effect of loss in the VMPFC we multplied the z-statistics maps with * -1 so all hypotheses are tested with high positive z-values indicating the effect of interest."	"We did not use small-volume correction. However we did use a-priori defined ROI’s to calculate our percentage of true discoveries (TDP) for (see section Inference, statistic type). The method we applied can estimate the lower bound of the number of truly active voxels for any ROI we specify, with FWER-guarantees over all possible hypotheses (i.e., we have a FWER of less than 5% over all the possible ROIs of our whole brain). 

The masks were constructed using the following method (the following is also reported under Analysis, General):

VMPFC. 
We took the intersection of the HarvardOxford cortical atlas thresholded at 50% for the Frontal Medial Cortex (FMC) and the meta-analytic co-activation results from Neurosynth at location (0, 41, -21) at z=13 which is the middle voxel of the FMC. This mask was diluted using the -dilM option of fslmaths (5.0.9). Number of voxels of mask: 709

Neurosynth details: “This image displays regions coactivated with the seed region across all studies in the Neurosynth database. It represents meta-analytic coactivation rather than time series-based connectivity.” And it was based on 249 studies reporting activation within 6 mm of (0, 40, -20), March 6, 2019.

Amygdala:

Ventral Striatum:
Mask based on the FSL striatal-atlas. Number of voxels in mask:
L=179, R=174, total = 353."	"We used the new method of All-Resolution Inference (ARI, Rosenblatt, Finos, Weeda, Solari & Goeman, 2018). The ARI method allows for flexible whole-brain inference with full FWER guarantees. Input for the method is a map of p-values and a set of cluster-masks (for this dataset the 3 ROIs, VMPFC, Amygdala and Ventral Striatum) and it returns the true discovery proportion (TDP). The TDP is the lower-bound estimate of the number of truly active voxels within a region.

Since ARI has full FWER control over all possible ROIs of the brain, we do need to adjust the p-value for the number of ROIs. 

The stated hypotheses are theory-driven and we are not interested in rejecting a global null hypothesis of no activation over all hypotheses. We decided not to correct for the number of hypotheses stated (i.e., over the 5 separate maps on which we base our conclusions).

All TDP’s are calculated using a 95% confidence."	We did not use alternative p-value computation.	We used the new method of All-Resolution Inference (ARI, Rosenblatt, Finos, Weeda, Solari & Goeman, 2018). We control the whole-brain Familywise Error rate (FWER) using the ARI method (over each of the four whole-brain maps separately).	"The All-Resolutions Inference (ARI) method of Rosenblatt, Finos, Weeda, Solari & Goeman (2018) is a novel approach to perform inference on brain maps. ARI allows researchers to estimate the proportion of truly active voxels (true discovery proportion, TDP) within freely chosen regions-of-interest (ROIs). These ROIs can be chosen based on a priori defined regions (e.g., anatomical regions or meta-analysis locations), but also based on ROIs derived from the same data (e.g., cluster-forming thresholds, or data from other experimental conditions). All analyses can be performed as many times as a researcher wants, all on the same data, with full family-wise error (FWE) control. The FWE is guaranteed over all-brain voxels as ARI is set in a closed-testing framework. Therefore, when we limit our conclusions over pre-defined ROIs as we do here, we still have whole-brain FWE control.
						
ARI gives the researcher almost unlimited freedom in selecting and analysing brain images. For example, researchers can use multiple thresholds within the same image or base analysis on activation data from the same experiment (which, when not properly controlled (as in standard analyses), is considered double-dipping). In addition, researchers are allowed to ""drill-down"" or zoom-in within these ROIs, without losing FWE control.

Given the flexible nature of ARI we are allowed to take a more exploratory approach (but with full FWER control) for testing the nine hypotheses.

All TDP’s are calculated using a 95% confidence. The expected TDP thresholds are in principle arbitrary. It reflects the author’s acceptable level of the proportion of active voxels to declare that region ‘active’. For the smaller ROIs (amygdala and ventral striatum) these levels are somewhat smaller than for the larger ROI (VMPFC). In other words, the following decision rules -- that we pre-registered and used to make our conclusions as reported above -- are not to be taken as rules of thumb, but we have set them in order to specify (and preregister) our decisions in advance as to not be influenced by the results during analysis and interpretation:    

Amygdala hypotheses:
• We reject the null hypothesis of no activation when we find a TDP of least .50 in the both left and right amygdala ROI (left + right combined mask). Or if we find, when drilling-down within the amygdala ROI, a region of minimal 40 contiguous voxels with at least .70 TDP.

Ventral Striatum hypotheses:
• We reject the null hypothesis of no activation when we find a TDP of least .50 in the both left and right ventral striatum ROI (left + right combined mask). Or if we find, when drilling-down within the ventral striatum ROI, a region of minimal 30 contiguous voxels with at least .70 TDP.

VMPFC hypotheses:
• We reject the null hypothesis of no activation when we find a TDP of least .50 in the VMPFC ROI. Or if we find, when drilling-down within the VMPFC ROI, a region of minimal 60 contiguous voxels with at least .70 TDP.

In addition, we have used the TDP’s for all hypotheses and relevant ROI’s as the rating of the confidence in our decision regarding the hypotheses in this final report. Intuitively, the estimate of the proportion of truly active voxels (TDP) maps onto the confidence one has in how many voxels are actually active within that ROI.  For example, if we find a .70 TDP in the amygdala we can state that with 95% confidence at least 70% of the voxels within the amygdala are truly active. This allows for a much more spatially specific testing of hypotheses.

First, at the group level, we analyzed grain and loss effects independently given how the nine hypotheses, above, were presented. For within-group analysis, we conducted voxel-wise, one-sample t-tests with zero as the referent value; for between-group analysis, we conducted voxel-wise two-sample t-tests (pooled variance) using age as a covariate (there was a trend-level confound in age (p = 0.07, one-sided) between the equal-range and equal-indifference groups) where this covariate was centered between (not within) groups to account for any confounding effects.  	mass univariate	Most of this (e.g., random vs. fixed effects) can be inferred from the above but I'll specify additionally that we did not attempt to account for residual autocorrelation in the first-level models even though such a facility exists in AFNI. My reasoning for not doing this is that we include only the subject-level, voxel-wise fits (betas) in the group-level analysis. These probably aren't affected by accounting for residual temporal auto-correlation.	There is not a lot for us to report here. The way the NARPS architects constructed the hypotheses (e.g., negative effect of loss in VMPFC in equal indifference group), it was not necessary to conduct linear contrasts of parameters or to perform ANOVAs.

fmriprep, version 1.1.4; Matlab R2017b "	One participant was excluded (‘sub-030’), resulting in a final sample of 107 participants 	"We excluded participant ('sub-030') after performing quality checks. 

Specifically, we checked both for excess movement (leading to the exclusion of ‘sub-030’) and repetitive behavioral choices (no further participant was excluded). 

Regarding behavioral choices, we reasoned that participants who persevered on one specific response (i.e., only ‘accept’ or only ‘reject’ on most trials) were likely not performing the task as intended and likely did not pay attention to the individual choice trials. Thus, if participants were to choose either option on less than 10 % of the trials, we planned to exclude them. This, however, was not an issue for any of the participants in the current sample.

Regarding movement, we considered displacement across the x-, y-, and z-directions as well as the derivative of the spatial root mean square variance over voxels (DVARS). One participant (‘sub-030’) was excluded from further analysis for two reasons - (1) excessive movement and (2) overall poor data quality:
(1) This participant was found to display a framewise displacement exceeding the voxel size (2 mm) on a total of 57 scans, and on 11 scans this displacement in fact exceeded two voxel sizes. These excessive movements were found on all four scan runs. In this respect, this participant is a clear outlier, as the only four other participants that were found to exhibit such extreme frame-wise displacement, only did so on one individual scan (three participants) or on two consecutive scans (one participant) across the whole experiment.
(2) Furthermore, inspection of the group quality control report of the BOLD-scans, as provided by FMRIPrep (MRIQC), revealed that all four runs from this participant were clear outliers in the whole group on the measured DVARS.
Upon further inspection of the MRIQC-report, the four functional scans of this participant were also clear outliers in terms of temporal signal-to-noise (tSNR), with all four runs displaying very low tSNR.

We used the fMRIprepped data. 	We did not perform a global intensity normalization before statistical modeling (no proportional scaling or grand mean scaling).  As is default in SPM, we did include regressors modelling the mean signal in each session in the first-level statistical model. 	"We did not correct for physiological noise during preprocessing. However, we did model nuisance regressors in the first-level general linear model. These included six motion parameters and global signal from two tissue types, namely cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter (WM).

The six head-motion parameters (i.e., translation in x, y, & z direction as well as pitch, roll, & yaw rotations) had been estimated during preprocessing (i.e., motion correction) using MCFLIRT (FSL 5.0.9) in fMRIprep. 

The global signal in tissue compartments were extracted using tissue masks that were also estimated during preprocessing (brain tissue segmentation) using FSL Fast (FSL 5.0.9). The six motion parameters as well as the mean tissue signal (CSF and WM) were extracted from the “confounds.tsv”-files."	We did not perform scrubbing or de-spiking of the data. We looked at excess movement by considering displacement across the x-, y-, and z-directions.  If this displacement was larger than the voxel-size (2 mm), we added an extra regressor to capture spurious effects produced by a large scan-by-scan displacement. This regressor consisted of a 1 at the scans where the movement had occurred and a 0 for all other scans. This procedure was applied for four participants where such a displacement occurred at either only a single scan (3 participants) or two consecutive scans (1 participant).	"
We applied spatial filtering using the smoothing function as implemented in SPM 12, update 7219. We used a fixed smoothing kernel of 8 mm FWHM. "	NA	"The dependent variable of the single-subject models (first-level general linear model) consisted of the four functional runs obtained from the preprocessing. Each of these four 4D-timeseries consisted of 453 timepoints, and at each of the 453 timepoints a 3D whole-brain volume was obtained.
The dependent variables included in the group models (second-level general linear model) were the single-subject contrast images. We excluded one participant (‘sub-030’) due to excess movement and signal variability, and thus the dependent variable consisted of 107 contrast images (54 for the ‘equal indifference’-models and 53 for the ‘equal range’ models). "	We modelled the “Full Brain”.	"For the first-level models, we included the following event-related design regressors: gamble (duration: 0 seconds) with two parametric modulators (‘gain’ and ‘loss’). The parametric modulators were formed by the mean-centred values of the ‘gain’ and ‘loss’ in the mixed-gamble scenarios. Importantly, the two regressors coding for gains and losses were not orthogonalized.

For functional runs that included trials with response times lower than 0.1 or no button presses, we included another regressor coding for these trials separately (duration: 0 seconds). We reasoned that participants were likely not paying attention or not properly performing the task on these trials, as they failed to respond or had a faster reaction time than is reasonably possible. All of these regressors were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function only (HRF). 

Furthermore, the model contained nuisance regressors modeling potential confounding effects. The six movement regressors included translation in the x, y, and z directions as well as the rotation in the pitch, roll and yaw directions. For four participants, we included another regressor for one of the four sessions, coding for the timepoint(s) where a movement translation had occurred that exceeded the threshold. The baseline was not explicitly modeled, but was implicit. Furthermore, we included the time series of the extracted mean signal from the white-matter (WM) compartment and the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) compartment as nuisance regressors. The model included regressors for the mean signal in each functional run.

The two-sample t-tests were used to test for differences between the ‘equal indifference’ and the ‘equal range’ groups, whereas the one-sample t-tests were used to test whether overall group effects were larger than 0.  	Mass Univariate.	"The first-level models were estimated using an autoregressive (AR(1)) model with Classical (REML) parameter estimation.

The second-level models were random-effects models estimated with ordinary least squares (OLS; SPM default). In the two-sample t-test model that was used to test hypothesis 9, variance was assumed to be unequal between the two groups, and the groups were assumed to be independent."	"Contrasts were calculated at both the 1st level and the 2nd level to test the specified hypotheses. At the 1st level (subject level), we contrasted the effect of the gain parametric modulator versus the implicit baseline (using a ‘1’ to code for the column of the parametric modulator, and a ‘0’ for all other columns). An analogous contrast was calculated to test for the effect of the loss parametric modulator.

The contrast images corresponding to these contrasts were then used for the 2nd level general linear model (random effects-model or group-model). For the 2nd level analysis, we estimated five different models. For both the ‘equal range’ and ‘equal indifference’ groups, we performed separate one-sample t-tests on both the ‘gains’ and ‘loss’ contrast maps. For the group comparisons, we calculated a two-sample t-test including the contrast maps for ‘loss’ separately for the ‘equal range’ and ‘equal indifference’ groups.

Positive effects of gain (hypotheses 1-4) were tested by a contrast including a ‘1’ for the single column of the 2nd level ‘gain’ model, for both the equal indifference group (hypotheses 1,3) and the equal range group (hypotheses 2,4). 

Positive effects of loss (hypotheses 7-8) were tested by a contrast including a ‘1’ for the single column of the 2nd level ‘loss’ model, for the equal indifference group (hypothesis 7) and the equal range group (hypothesis 8). 

Negative effects of loss (hypotheses 5-6) were tested by a contrast including a ‘-1’ for the single column of the 2nd level ‘loss’ model, for the equal indifference group (hypothesis 5) and the equal range group (hypothesis 6). 

Greater response to losses for the ‘equal range’ group versus the ‘equal indifference’ group (hypothesis 9) was tested by a linear contrast in the two-sample t-test model, including a ‘1’ for the column of the ‘equal range’ group, and a ‘-1’ for the column of the ‘equal indifference’ group.

We used the whole brain as a search region."	We applied a cluster-forming threshold of p<0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. We then performed cluster-inference using FWE correction (threshold of p<0.05) on these thresholded maps.  	Standard parametric inference was used to obtain voxel-wise p-values.	Multiple testing correction was applied using family-wise error correction (according to Random Field Theory) for the whole brain, as implemented in SPM.

In this subject, a large portion of brain tissue had been improperly cut out when masking voxels for the GLM analysis.	Yes	Pre-processing steps for each of the four fMRI runs were: correction of geometrical distortions and head motion, coregistration to T1w and alignment into the MNI152 space. Obtained timeseries were then smoothed and normalized so that the average activity of each voxel in time was zero and deviations from the average were expressed as percentage.	For each subject, brain extraction of the T1w image was performed using ANTs (v2.2.0) and the antsBrainExtraction.sh script, with OASIS as reference template. The obtained brain mask was also applied to fMRI data after coregistration to the T1w image.	For structural images, brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid, grey and white matter was carried out using fast (FSL 5.0.9).	No slice time correction has been applied to data.	Head motion was estimated and corrected using mcflirt as part of the FSL suite (v5.0.9). Translations and rotations on the x, y and z axes (i.e., 6 DOF) were computed using the middle image as reference and normalized correlation as metric. EPI susceptibility distortions were corrected using a custom workflow of fMRIPrep derived from D. Greve's epidewarp.fsl script and further improvements of HCP Pipelines. All resamplings were performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the transformations using antsApplyTransforms and the Lanczos algorithm.		NA	fMRI timeseries were coregistered to the T1w reference image using boundary-based registration (i.e., bbregister). Nine degrees of freedom transformation was applied to account for residual EPI distortions.	NA	Brain extracted and bias corrected T1w images were nonlinearly transformed to match the T1w ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c (1mm isotropic resolution) using the antsRegistration script.	The T1w image was corrected for intensity bias using the N4BiasFieldCorrection implemented in ANTs (2.2.0).	Each fMRI run was normalized so that the average activity of each voxel in time was zero and deviations from the average were expressed as percentage - i.e., (timeseries/average*100)-100. 	To attenuate physiological noise, the six head motion parameters were included as regressors of no interest in the single-subject GLM design matrix.	No volume censoring has been applied.	Preprocessed data were smoothed in the MNI volume space using 3dBlurToFWHM (AFNI v 17.0.13). BOLD timeseries were iteratively smoothed until 5mm FWHM was reached.	NA	Four fMRI runs were submitted to statistical modeling at single-subject level. Thus, for each subject 1,812 timepoints (256 trials) represented the dependent variable of the GLM analysis. At group level, 54 subjects were considered for the equal indifference experiment, whereas 53 were included in the equal range condition (i.e., sub-006 was excluded). The comparison between the two conditions (i.e., hypothesis 9) was carried out on 107 subjects.	Both single-subject and group-level analysis were performed considering the whole brain.	To analyze the parametric effect of gains and losses, we used the stim_times_AM2 option included in 3dDeconvolve (AFNI v17.0.13). Of the 256 original trials, we considered valid only those in which the participant provided a response within 4 seconds. Each valid trial was convolved with a block waveform, whose duration was determined by response time (dmBLOCK option) and whose amplitude was modulated by two distinct factors: the potential gain and loss. This resulted in three regressors of interest: one representing the predicted response regardless of potential gain and loss and the other two encoding the proportional change due to potential gain and loss, respectively. These two parametric regressors were also centered on the average value of gains and losses across trials: 25 for gains in the equal indifference condition, 12.5 for gains and losses in the equal range condition as well as for losses in the equal indifference experiment. Trials in which the participant did not provide a response were modeled using a 4 seconds (i.e., maximum time for the task) block waveform and added to the design matrix. Other regressors of no interest included the head motion parameters and 1st to 4th degree polynomial functions to account for low-frequency fluctuations in the fMRI timeseries.	duration	1	To test hypotheses 1 to 8, we used the one-sample test implemented in randomise (FSL) and measured whether the parametric modulation of gains and losses was significantly different from zero. In brief, for each of the two parametric regressors, T-values were averaged across subjects and the obtained value was tested against a null distribution built using a random sign flipping procedure (10,000 iterations). For hypothesis 9, a two-sample non-parametric unpaired test was carried out using the same tool. Here, the actual difference between the two samples was tested against a null distribution obtained by randomly shuffling subjects labels at each iteration (10,000). No between-subject covariates were included in the design matrix.	Mass univariate whole brain approach.	"For the single-subject design, we used a generalized least squares fit (3dREMLfit) that takes into account the temporal auto-correlation of timeseries (ARMA(1,1)). 
For the group-level analysis the OLS fitting and non-parametric testing were performed."	For hypotheses 1 to 4, we used the non-parametric one-sample approach and tested the existence of a positive association between gains and BOLD activity (one tail p<0.05 TFCE corrected). Using the same approach, we evaluated the existence of both positive (one tail p<0.05 TFCE corrected) and negative (one tail p<0.05 TFCE corrected) relationships between losses and BOLD activity (i.e., hypotheses 5 to 8). Lastly, for hypothesis 9, we tested whether the positive association between losses and brain activity was stronger in the equal range, as compare to the equal indifference condition (one tail p<0.05 TFCE corrected). We tested such hypothesis using a non-parametric permutation approach and two-samples unpaired test.	Significance of the aforementioned associations were tested using a mass-univariate whole brain approach.	"The threshold-free cluster-enhancement (TFCE) method was used to correct for multiple comparisons. We used 5mm sigma variance smoothing to improve the estimation of the variance that feeds into the final ""t"" statistic image."	As described above pvalues were obtained through non-parametric testing (i.e., FSL randomise), using 10,000 iterations.	"For all the contrasts of interest we used permutation test (10,000 iterations). The search for significance was restricted to brain voxels using a group-average brain mask.

0H5E	https://neurovault.org/collections/4936/	"Our responses are complicated somewhat by the fact that SPM masks out voxels with low signal, and in group analyses, if any one subject is missing a voxel, that voxel is masked out of the entire analysis. In this dataset, the amygdala ended up masked out of the whole-brain group analysis for both groups, and the ventral striatum ended up masked out of the equal indifference group only. So, by the rules that we are supposed to report whole-brain analysis results, we have to say ""No"" for any regions that did not appear in the whole-brain analysis, but really a ""Not applicable"" response would be more appropriate. To help supplement the whole-brain corrected-threshold results, we also looked at whole-brain results at an uncorrected threshold of p<.05 (cluster size = 5 voxels) and ran ROI analyses based on manually selected coordinates for ventral striatum and amygdala within a small sphere. Our confidence values are thus partially based on the outcomes of these supplementary analyses. We also recognize that not every analysis package masks out low-signal voxels as aggressively as SPM, which has partially informed our judgments about similarity to other teams. Further notes on each hypothesis are below.
Hypothesis 1 -- Did not show up at corrected threshold but did show up at an uncorrected threshold (and was marginally significant in an ROI analysis), so we think a Type II error is reasonably likely and the hypothesis might have been confirmed in a larger sample.

Hypothesis 2 -- Did not show up at any threshold (corrected or uncorrected up to p<.05) and also did not show up in ROI analysis, so we are reasonably confident in our rejection of this one.

Hypothesis 3 -- Did not show up at any threshold, but we confirmed that ventral striatum was not in the mask for the analysis, so it would not be expected to. However, even with manually selected ROIs, the hypothesis was not confirmed anyway (p=.5).

Hypothesis 4 -- Did show up at the corrected threshold (and thus enough of ventral striatum was in-mask for the analysis to work), and also came out significantly in our manually selected ROI analysis (p=.03).

Hypothesis 5 -- There was a very large and obvious cluster even at the corrected threshold, and it was also highly significant in our ROI analysis (p=1.6e-5).

Hypothesis 6 -- Did not show up at corrected threshold but at an uncorrected threshold there was a fairly clear cluster, although the ROI analysis was not significant (p=.14). So we think there is some chance of a Type II error and that the hypothesis might be confirmed in a larger sample, but with a bit less confidence than we had for Hypothesis 1. (Less confident of a possible Type II error, that is -- i.e., a bit more confident in our main result that Hypothesis 6 was not confirmed.)

Hypothesis 7 -- Did not show up at any threshold but we confirmed that amygdala was not in the mask for the analysis, so it would not be expected to. The effect WAS significant with manually selected ROIs (p=2.3e-5) -- but in the opposite direction of what was hypothesized (i.e., we found a negative effect of loss). Thus, by our interpretation of the rules, we are reporting this as ""hypothesis not confirmed"" with fairly high confidence, as the whole-brain analysis did not have any information about the amygdala and the ROI analysis actually contradicted the hypothesis.

Hypothesis 8 -- Did not show up at any threshold but again was not in the analysis mask. However, nothing was significant in the ROI analysis either (p=.41).

Hypothesis 9 -- This one is tricky to report, as we knew the amygdala did not appear in the whole-brain analysis mask for either group, and thus it was formally impossible to test with a whole-brain group analysis as instructed. However, in our ROI analysis, the hypothesis appeared to be confirmed (p=.019), although both means were negative, so really the ""greater response to losses"" for the equal range group would be more accurately described as a ""less negative response to losses."" By our interpretation of the rules, we are reporting this as ""hypothesis not confirmed"" in the whole-brain analyses because it can't really be tested with our standard pipeline, although we know the ROI analysis does seem to confirm the hypothesis, hence the low confidence we reported for the whole-brain ""result."" Note that we did run the stats model we would have run for the whole-brain analyses merely for purposes of uploading to NeuroVault, but we know there are no amygdala voxels in it.
"	No	NA	"For the whole-brain analyses, we mostly used our own expertise in neuroanatomy combined with searches of the literature, especially for the subcortical structures. For vmPFC, whole-brain results were fortunately all unambiguous (either large portions of what was unmistably vmPFC were activated, or nothing in that general region was), but in all cases, we did also compare our judgments to NeuroSynth masks that matched those anatomical search terms. Typically we would not frame our hypothesis exactly the way they were in this study -- e.g., testing the hypothesis ""is there an effect in vmPFC?"" with a whole-brain analysis, as instructed. Either we would have an anatomical hypothesis that we would test with an ROI analysis (based either on coordinates from an atlas/meta-analysis, a functional localizer, or manual definition of the anatomial boundaries), OR we would run a whole-brain analysis and simply report loci of activity descriptively (i.e., listing the significant clusters and assigning anatomical labels as accurately as possible to the voxels within those clusters, but with no specific a priori hypotheses about the regions activated). So the way the project was framed did not fit exactly into our standard way of making inferences, and we simply did our best to accommodate the requirements without changing too much of our standard process."

Other notes: Basic fixed (non-iterative) 9mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel. All in volume space after all registration steps (i.e., after all subjects are in MNI space). True confession time: We originally used a 6mm kernel but after running some preliminary sanity checks on the group analyses, we decided too many voxels were getting masked out of the group analysis due to anatomical inconsistencies between subjects, so we re-ran the smoothing at 9mm and used that for the final analyses. We would normally use a smaller kernel but also our typical sample sizes are smaller than in this dataset (closer to N=20 and a single subject group), and because of the way SPM masks out voxels from group analyses, the higher the N, the more voxels are going to get masked out --  hence our decision to smooth more in order not to over-mask the group analyses. (This still did not work perfectly in the case of amygdala and ventral striatum, but we did our best.) "	The one pre-processing step we did that wasn't discussed here (but which was mentioned in our description of overal pre-processing sequence) was a resampling step we did between all the linear transformations on the functional images and the nonlinear (warping) transformation. We only do this as a separate step because we try to avoid resampling the functional images a bunch of times without need if all the transformations are doing is updating the NIfTI header's affine transformation matrix, which is true for our initial motion correction and linear coregistration steps, but we do like to save a resampled copy of the images with all of those affine transformations applied before any subsequent steps. (This is normally so we can do certain statistical analyses in individual-subject space that has been loosely affine-registered with standard space but not warped... we did not have to do any such analyses in this particular case but it is part of our standard processing stream, so we left it in.) Unfortunately SPM8's coregistration routine has a weird feature where it will only resample output images at the same voxel size as the reference image (even though the normalization routine will let you freely select a bounding box and voxel size). We did not want to resample all functional images at the resolution of our anatomical template, and unfortunately SPM8 does not provide a pure image-resampling function, so our hacked-together solution is to generate a spatial normalization matrix defining a null transformation and apply that to the functional images through the SPM8 normalization routine, which effectively resamples the images to the desired resolution without transforming them (but with any affine transformations from the NIfTI header applied prior to resampling and then zero'ed out in the resampled images). We chose to resample to 2.5mm isotropic voxels as that is the usual size at which we currently acquire our own fMRI data (and a convenient size to work with in general), although arguments could be made that another size could be more optimal for the NARPS dataset that was originally acquired at a different voxel size.   	All timepoints except for the removal of the first four volumes in each run (as discussed above), and all subjects except those specifically removed (as described above). We used all runs from every subject left in the analysis.	"Full brain -- although as we noted at the top, this didn't really work as intended because SPM8 masked out essentially all amygdala voxels from the group analysis, due to one or more subject(s) having low signal, as well as most/all of the ventral striatum voxels for one of the participant groups. As such, inferences for those regions were not really possible following our standard pre-processing and stats procedures, even after expanding our initially chosen smoothing kernel and excluding subjects whose brains did not fit the groupwise in-brain voxel mask very well. This is not normally an issue for us because 1) we typically focus on areas that do not suffer from low signal, e.g. visual cortex and frontoparietal regions; 2) we typically have smaller samples (~20), and the more participants in a sample, the more voxels SPM8 is going to mask out of the group analysis; and 3) we don't do too many groupwise whole-brain analyses these days anyway (most of our analyses are things like MVPA which are all run at the single-subject level and do not require second-level fMRI group analyses), and if we were focusing on tricky areas like the amygdala or ventral striatum, we would typically use an ROI approach. As such, we did do the supplementary ROI analyses described earlier, where we essentially chose a single voxel from each region of interest for each subject (left amygdala, right amygdala, left ventral striatum, right ventral striatum) based on examining the functional and anatomical images, extracted a small (6mm radius) sphere around each one, averaged the relevant values from the first-level analysis in each sphere (excluding any NaN values using Matlab's 'nanmean' function), averaged left and right (excluding either one if all of its voxels were NaN values), and used that resultant value as the subject's value for that ROI in the subsequent group analysis. ROI analyses for VMPFC were similar, except we used the same seed voxel for everyone ([0 48 -8], the maximum voxel in the Neurosynth ""ventromedial"" meta-analysis) and a slightly larger sphere (10mm radius), and did not run separate analyses for left and right since the ROI was medial."	"We used SPM8's ""parametric modulations"" feature, using the values specified in the NARPS data for each gain/loss parameter (1st order/linear effects only). The durations were modeled as 4sec because that was the value in the timing files we were given. Not sure what you mean exactly by ""block design"" predictors -- if you mean how runs were modeled, we did what most people do in SPM analyses -- modeled all of the runs in a single first-level model for each subject, with SPM automatically adding a regressor of all 1's for each run to model out the mean/baseline for that run. We used the canonical HRF included in SPM8 with no derivatives. We did not include regressors for motion or drift, although we did use SPM's default high-pass filter (128sec period). No other nuisance regressors. Other first-level parameters included: microtime resolution=16 (default), microtime onset=1 (default), model Volterra interactions=no, Global normalisation=none, no explicit mask, serial correlations=AR(1).

Orthogonalization of regressors -- this got a little weird. It is our understanding that SPM orthogonalizes parametric regressors in the order they are entered (i.e. the second parametric modulator essentially gets whatever variance is left over from the first; see e.g. http://andysbrainblog.blogspot.com/2014/08/parametric-modulation-with-spm-why.html). In theory this should not be a big deal if the regressors were properly orthogonalized in the design, but just in case, our solution was actually to run the first-level stats for each subject twice -- always putting both regressors in the model, but once entering the effect of gains first (followed by losses), and once entering losses first (followed by gains). The reasoning was that we wanted to emulate the logic of doing Type III sum of squares e.g. in an ANOVA model -- considering only the unique contributions of the regressor in question after the other effects had been accounted for. Thus, to get the effect of losses, we used the model in which gains had been entered first, and to get the effect of gains, we used the model in which losses had been entered first.

At the first level, we then entered a contrast to get the positive effect of gains for the losses-first model or the positive effect of losses for the gains-first model, e.g. [0 0 .25 0 0 .25 0 0 .25 0 0 .25 0 0 0 0] to get a contrast image that effectively averaged the beta values across runs for each subject."	none	0	"Group stats were very simple in most cases. We just used the ""one-sample t-test"" 2nd-level model type in SPM8 and used the contrast images from the 1st-level analysis, with no covariates, implicit masking only, no ""global calculation"" or ""overall grand mean scaling"" or ""normalisation"" (these latter three being PET-only settings). Separate analyses were used for the effect of gains for range group, gains/indifference group, losses/range, and losses/indifference. For the effect of losses, in which we were asked to provide results in both positive and negative directions, we just specified two contrasts in the group model -- one of [+1] and one of [-1], with the latter simply reversing the direction of the test. For hypothesis 9, the question of how between-groups effects were modeled was moot, because we knew the amygdala values would be masked out. However, our supplementary ROI analysis for that hypothesis was done using a simple two-sample t-test (equal variances assumed since the assumption was not violated, although it did not affect the outcome either way to assume equal variances or not). Purely for purposes of uploading to NeuroVault, we did run the whole-brain between-groups model we would have run for hypothesis 9, which was a ""two-sample t-test"" SPM8 group model with independence=yes, variance=unequal, grand mean scaling=no, ANCOVA=no, no covariates, implicit masking only, no ""global calculation"" or ""overall grand mean scaling"" or ""normalisation"" (these latter three being PET-only settings)."

From the logs, fmriprep involves antomcial pre-processing entailing bias field correction, skullstripping, spatial normalisation and tissue segmentation. Pre-processing of functional images comprised: EPI was skull stripped, distortion corrected, motion parameters were calculated, motion correction and distoritions were corrected within a unified framework. Resampled EPI images were coregistered to the anatomical image and spatially normalised to the MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. Confounding signals, and physiological signals were calculated. Of note, the aCompCor signals were generated. "	The T1w-reference was skull-stripped using antsBrainExtraction.sh (ANTs 2.2.0), using OASIS as target template. An EPI reference volume was skull-stripped using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep.	Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001).

The BOLD time-series were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions.		NA	The BOLD reference was co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl 2009). Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference.   	A deformation field to correct for susceptibility distortions was estimated based on a field map that was co-registered to the BOLD reference, using a custom workflow of fMRIPrep derived from D. Greve’s epidewarp.fsl script and further improvements of HCP Pipelines (Glasser et al. 2013). Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, an unwarped BOLD reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002).

Full brain	"All trials were modelled with a single event related regressor where each event was modelled with a duration of 4secs, and a canonical hemodynamic response function. Three parametric modulators were modelled; one modulator that captured the distance each item mixed gamble deviated from equivalance with the following formula [distance from equivalence = absolute_value(0.5*gain - loss). SPM implements parametric modulators by orthogonalising parametric regressors sequentially. Thus to ensure the gain and loss regressors were calculated appropriates, two GLM were carried out. Regressors for the gain modulator were obtained in a model wherein loss was added as the second parametric modulator and then gain was added as the thrid parametric modulator, whereas the regressor for the loss modulator was obtained in a model wherein gain was added as the second parametric modulator and then loss was added as the thrid parametric modulator. Finally, the six motion parameters, the 5 aCompCor parameters, the global white matter and cerebral spinal fluid signals were included as nuisance regressors. Signal drift was removed with a discrete cosine transform with cutoff of 128 secs, and an AR1 noise model.

All images of a session were realigned to the mean of the session. A linear registration was applied in combination with normalized correlation as an image similarity metric, whereas no motion susceptibility correction was utilized 		No gradient distortion correction was applied.	The mean image of the realigned images was used to co-register the functional images to the subject specific anatomical image. This co-registration was based on FSL’s FEAT pipeline and uses a two-step co-registration. The first step uses the anatomical image to pre-align the mean image, followed by the second co-registration step where the white matter probabilistic image computed with SPM’s segmentation function is used together with the anatomical image in a boundary-based registration (BBR) approach to co-register the slice-time corrected mean image to the anatomy. This co-registration is then applied to all functional images of the session.	No distortion correction was applied.	T1w native  to reference space volume based registration was computed and applied using FSL, SPM, Nilearn and ANTs. In more detail, the lower head parts and neck were removed from the T1w images through FSL’s RobustFOV and subsequently intensity corrected via ANTs’ N4BiasFieldCorrection. Afterwards, images were segmented using SPM’s NewSegment to create a brain mask and extract respective voxels, both through Nilearn. The extracted brain was then submitted to ANTs’ registration function  (Bspline interpolation with rigid, affine and syn transforms) with the ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template32 (version 2009c, 1mm iso) serving as the template. Using a linear transformation the resulting parameters were applied using ANT’s ApplyTransform.

Bias field corrections for structural MRI was performed using ANTs N4BiasFieldCorrection.	No intensity normalization was performed	Prior to the spatial smoothing, functional images were used to compute confound regressors, such as Framewise Displacement (FD), DVARS to identify motion-affected frames, as well as average signal within the whole brain volume (GM, WM and CSF combined) using Nilearn. FD, DVARS and average signal in whole brain were used as nuisance regressors. Six motion parameters (from FSL's MCFLIRT; 3 translation and 3 rotation) were also used as nuisance regressors.	Volumes at the beginning, detected as non-steady-state volumes (using Nipype), were removed from the functional images, prior any further preprocessing. Otherwise, no scrubbing or de-spiking was performed.	Functional images were spatially smoothed with a smoothing kernel with FWHM of 6 mm using Nilearn.

Button presses were modelled as a separate condition of no interest: they were modelled as delta functions (duration = 0) with onsets defined by the trial onset + reaction time relative to that trial. They were then convolved with the HRF (see below).

Trials with no reponse or very short reponses (< 500 ms) were modelled separately in another condition of no interest.

First, all trials across all 4 runs were modeled using an event-design, trial duration of 4 sec, and canonical HRF. Two orthogonal parametric regressors were included that indicated the amount of gain and amount of loss at each trial. Finally, we modeled the effect of run as a regressor of no interest.

This variable was represented in complete disjunctive coding as four binary variables (presence as 1 vs. absence as 0 for each category). 	"Multivariate intra- and inter-subject predictive. Specific method: Mean-centered partial least squares (mcPLS) a.k.a. barycentric discriminant analysis. Note: We did not compute classification accuracy (image to its respective second or group level) because it was not a question of interest; though mcPLS was designed to do so. Rather, we used mcPLS as in the typical PLS framework: model the relationship between two sets of variables (i.e., 4 levels of the design as specified above, and parametrically modeled images). mcPLS works as follows:
1.	Compute covariance matrix between design and images (4 x 196,299)
2.	Apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to covariance matrix to obtain orthogonal components in descending order (by explained variance)
3.	Compute component scores for the rows (design) and columns (voxels)
4.	Compute latent variable scores (each row from initial matrices) as projection of each matrix (design, SPMs) onto their respective component scores. 

 We used split-half resampling to assess component/latent variable reproducibility  and bootstrap resampling to identify stable variables (design groups, voxels) per reproducible component. For more details see references provided at the end of this report "	"First level:  Serial correlations accounted for using AR(1) model during parameter estimation (SPM 12)

Second level: Mean-centered partial least squares (mcPLS; a.k.a. barycentric discriminant analysis). We required stratified and balanced resampling approaches. We describe that in detail here as this information is critical for all following subsections.

Resampling required specific constraints because of non-independence and the need for a balanced design. For each iteration, split-half and bootstrap resamplings were applied twice each: once to choose individuals from the equal range group and again to choose individuals from the equal indifference group (the between group factor). In this experiment, the unit of selection was the individual participant not the individual image, thus when an individual participant was selected (from the between group factor) both their gain and loss images (within group factor) were included the respective sample. The experimental design was maintained and the non-independence accounted for by selecting individual participants from each between group factor (range vs. indifference) and using both their gain and loss images. 

Split-half resampling was performed to assess the reproducibility of components/latent variables. For each iteration, the data were split into two (equal sized, balanced design) data sets. McPLS was performed on each data separately. The individuals (and images) from one split-half were projected onto (""predicted by"") the results of the opposite split-half. We computed average squared correlations between the latent variable scores from each mcPLS and the respective predicted latent variable scores. The distributions of squared correlations were used to identify which components/latent variables to maintain and interpret. 

Bootstrap resampling (i.e., resampling with replacement) was used to assess the stability of variables (design groups, voxels). For each iteration: 
1.	A complete set of bootstrapped data (according to our resampling constraints) was projected onto the base model to assess the stability of variables for the entire design. 
2.	Each of the four groups (second and group level) were then separately projected onto the components through their respective component scores; this second projection provided estimates for each group individually (as opposed to the entire design) which allowed us to directly answer questions (hypotheses) 1-8. 
3.	The set of bootstrapped loss images were projected onto the the respective loss component scores which allowed us to directly answer question (hypothesis) 9. "	"First level images were modeled parametrically as a function of gain or loss. Each individual had two images: a gain image and a loss image. These images belonged to either the equal range or equal indifference group. 

Inference was performed at the second level in two ways: (1) to assess the stability and structure of the entire experiment via the base model (discriminant based on interaction of factors, as described above) and (2) projection of groups or image sets (i.e., gain or loss images by group) onto the components (post-hoc) in order to answer the hypotheses. Resampling procedures were used to create distributions, and from those distributions we derived test statistics.

For split-half resampling we inspect the distributions of r-squared values for each component to decide which to keep. For bootstrap resampling, we computed a test statistic called the ""bootstrap ratio""ù (BSR), which is the mean of the bootstrap distribution divided by its standard deviation; the BSR is akin to a Z- or t-test. BSRs of +/- 3 are approximately p=0.001, one-sided. BRSs are one-sided because they have the same sign as the loadings/component scores from the mcPLS. We used BSRs of +/- 3 as a corrected cutoff. "	To answer questions 1-9, we only used voxels that had BSRs of +/- 3 in both: (1) the base model and (2) each post-hoc projected group. We used those identified voxels in conjunction with the direction (sign) of their loadings from the design variable and BSRs, as well as masks for the vmPFC, amygdala, and ventral striatum generated from the Harvard Oxford Atlas to answer questions 1-9. 	We retain all voxels with BSRs > +/- 3 in both the base model and each projected set. We then only considered clusters of voxels in which there were at least 10 contiguous BSR > +/- 3 voxels when confirming or rejecting each hypothesis.	"We did not use p-values. 

To identify reproducible components/latent variables: We looked at the distribution of r-squared values from split-half resampling (in conjunction with summary statistics of these distributions, e.g., mean, median, ranges). We retained only components we deemed highly reproducible. The first latent variable had a mean reproducibility of approximately .8; the two subsequent latent variables were < .2. 

To identify stable voxels: We used bootstrap ratios (BSRs) which were test statistics derived from bootstrap distributions. BSRs are akin to Z- or t-tests. Our BSR cutoff was +/- 3, which is analogous to a parametric one-sided Z test with approximately p=0.001.

All resampling performed used N=250 iterations     "	No explicit correction for multiple comparisons was used. Given the results, we used a high cutoff to identify reproducible components (see above), and we used a slightly conservative voxel-wise test statistic for thresholded images (BSR was +/- 3, which is approximately analogous to a one-sided Z test with approximately p=0.001). To answer the questions (hypotheses) we also required a minimum of 10 contiguous voxels with BSR magnitude > +/- 3 within the pre-specified regions (as determined from the Harvard Oxford Atlas).

No	fMRI data preprocessing was performed using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping; Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK). A voxel displacement map (VDM) was first calculated from the field map to account for the spatial distortion resulting from the magnetic field inhomogeneity (Jezzard and Balaban, 1995; Andersson et al., 2001; Hutton et al., 2002). Incorporating this VDM, the EPI images were then corrected for motion and spatial distortions through realignment and unwarping (Andersson et al., 2001). Image preprocessing continued with slice timing correction using the middle slice of the volume as the reference. The participants’ anatomical images were manually checked and corrected for the origin by resetting it to the AC-PC. The EPI images were then coregistered to this origin-corrected anatomical image. The anatomical image was skull stripped and segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF, using the “Segment” tool in SPM12. These gray and white matter images were used in the SPM12 DARTEL toolbox to create individual flow fields as well as a group anatomical template (Ashburner, 2007) The EPI images were then normalized to the MNI space using the respective flow fields through the DARTEL toolbox normalization tool.

The bilateral amygdala was created from the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical Atlas, and the ventral striatum was created from the Oxford-GSK Imanova Structural Striatal Atlas. The vmPFC was created by binarizing the Frontal Pole, Frontal Medial Cortex, and Subcallosal Cortex regions from the Harvard-Oxford Cortical Atlas, and taking the union with AFNI's 3dmask_tool. The boundaries of the vmPFC were defined as x-coordinates between -16 and +16, y- coordinates greater than +8, and z-coordinates less than 0 (all coordinates in MNI space). We considered an effect as located within that region if the center of mass of the cluster for that effect fell within one of the corresponding masks that we created.

The stripped anatomical was then submitted to FSL's FAST for tissue segmentation. Anatomical images were normalized to the ICBM 2009c Nonlinear Asymmetric template (MNI space, 1x1x1mm voxel resolution) space using nonlinear warps with ANTs' antsRegistration tool. Head motion was estimated with FSL's mcflirt using rigid-body transformations before running slice-time correction with AFNI's 3dTshift. The resulting images were then corrected for susceptibility distortions. EPI to T1 registration was performed by aligning a reference EPI image for each run to the gray/white matter boundary estimated by FreeSurfer's lh.white and rh.white surfaces using the bbregister tool. These preprocessed functional images were then warped to MNI space using the transformations estimated from the T1-to-MNI normalization. ICA-AROMA was used to remove independent components of noise from the data. Lastly, a 4mm FWHMx smoothing kernel was then applied to the functional images using AFNI's 3dmerge before scaling each run's signal to a mean of 100.

ICA-AROMA was used to identify components reflecting noise, and then filtered those components out of the data using fsl_regfilt. Motion parameters output by AFNI's 3dvolreg during intra-subject coregistration were input to the corresponding subject's 1st-level statistical model. These motion files were used with 3dDeconvolve's stim_file option and were not convolved with a basis function. No higher-order derivatives of the motion parameters were used in the model.	A censor file was created for any volumes in a run with a derivative of the Euclidean norm higher than 0.3 relative to the reference scan.	A fixed 4mm FWHM smoothing kernel was applied to the normalized functional scans using AFNI's 3dmerge.	All of the preprocessing steps aside from smoothing, scaling, and scrubbing, are based on what we have inferred from the fmriprep documentation. Since we did not apply fmriprep ourselves, our report reflects our best estimate of which defaults and parameters were used for the preprocessed data that was given to us.	Each subject had 4 runs of functional imaging data with 453 volumes within each run. Volumes were censored (i.e., excluded from the model) if their derivative values had a Euclidean Norm above 0.3. A subject was excluded if more than 10% of their volumes were censored. As a results, subject sub-030 was excluded from further analysis.	No spatial region model was used.	Each trial was modeled as a 4s epoch using AFNI's dmBLOCK basis function. No temporal or dispersion derivatives were used. Magnitude of gain and magnitude of loss were mean-centered and then used as parametric modulators for each trial using AFNI's stim_times_AM2 option. Motion parameters for each run were entered into the model directly without being convolved with a basis function. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-order polynomial functions were used to model signal drift.	none	1	Group-level effects were calculated for positive and negative effects of parametric gain and loss separately within the equalIndifference and equalRange groups, as specified on the NARPS website. One of the group-level models directly compared the equalIndifference and equalRange groups (i.e., to test hypothesis #9 on the NARPS website). No covariates or other between-subject effects were included in the group-level model.	Mass Univariate.	"AFNI's 3dDeconolve was used to generate a design matrix for each subject. The details of this design matrix are specified above in the ""Independent variables -first level"" section. This design matrix was submitted to AFNI's 3dREMLfit, which uses a 2-parameter ARMA(1,1) correlation model to estimate temporal auto-correlation. The beta weights and corresponding t-statistics for each regressor were then submitted to a group-level analysis using AFNI's 3dMEMA, which weights each subject's beta weight by its corresponding t- statistic. Beta weights with higher t-statistics (e.g., lower variance) from each subject-level analysis are weighted more than beta weights with lower t-statistics. Groups were assumed to have unequal variance, which was specified in 3dMEMA using the -unequal_variance option."	For the individual parametric modulator analysis, the beta weights and corresponding t- statistics for each parametric modulator (Gain and Loss) were submitted to one-sample t-tests using AFNI's 3dMEMA. The beta weights and corresponding t-statistics for the parametric effect of Loss were compared between groups with the contrast [equalRange > equalIndifference] using AFNI's 3dMEMA. All tests were conducted using two-sided tests. No omnibus ANOVA tests were conducted.	Whole brain.	We used cluster-wise (cluster size) inference with a cluster-forming threshold of p=0.001 and a cluster size of k=20 voxels, as determined by AFNI's 3dClustSim (for more details see the “Inference: Multiple testing correction” section below).	Standard parametric inference was used.	We first estimated the smoothness of each subject's data by applying AFNI's 3dFWHMx (with the -acf option) to the residual time series (errts+tlrc) output from 3dDeconvolve. The autocorrelation function parameters output by 3dFWHMx were then used as inputs into AFNI's 3dClustSim as non-Gaussian filters (Eklund et al., 2016). We calculated a familywise error rate for our clusters with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations in AFNI's 3dClustSim, and used each subject's whole-brain mask estimated with AFNI's 3dAutomask. We used the estimates from 3dClustSim that were reported with bi-sided thresholding and with voxels that had touching faces. Lastly, the individual cluster thresholds were averaged across subjects to provide a group-level cluster threshold of k=20.	Before we ran our analysis, we decided to use a cluster-defining threshold of p=0.001 and cluster-wise p<0.05. We chose this threshold because is it endorsed by both critics and advocates of random-field theory (Eklund et al., 2016; Flandin & Friston, 2017), and also because of the strong effects in the vmPFC and ventral striatum shown in the Tom et al. 2007 paper. Using this threshold we found effects for only a few of the ex ante hypotheses. However, we recognize that, for a priori defined small regions, like the ventral striatum, it might be better suited to use a region-of-interest (ROI) rather than a voxel-based approach, as requested here. Indeed, using the ventral striatum mask from the Oxford-GSK Imanova Structural Striatal Atlas as an ROI, we identified a positive effect of gain in the equal range group (t(52)=3.57, p<0.001). Thus, based on theory about the role of the vmPFC and ventral striatum, as well as previous results, we find it plausible that the ventral striatum effects do exist, but not at the threshold we initially used.		atlas HOA	atlas Oxford-Imanova Striatal Structural Atlas	atlas HOA	AFNI	AFNI 18.2.15	4	parametric	p<0.001	ClustSim

I9D6	https://neurovault.org/collections/4978/	There are many choices in the analysis that were left to the researchers where several reasonable choices could be made;  that is, one might expect a fairly large variance in results reporting just from the consequences of making these choices independently from many different groups (let alone that other groups may have significantly different opinions on and strategies for analysis).  For modeling the stimuli, we chose one of the simplest forms, which ignored the portion of the stimulus between the subject response and the end of the 4 second stimulus, for example.  We chose to use two-sided testing, as we would for a standard/real FMRI study where we did not know a priori an expected direction of effect, and then answered this specific questions based on those results (even though the questions were sided -- we viewed that more as a consequence of how the NARPs study was organized to have specific binary results to compare across groups);  this choice might lead to more conservative evaluation of results than other choices.  Additionally, we chose to correct the final FPR of each group analysis by the overall number of independent group t-tests being reported (5), which leads to a conservative evaluation of group results -- in particular, this is why we report our confidence that hypothesis 5 is “unconfirmed” as low, since it would have passed the threshold for statistical significance if the Bonferroni correction had not been made.  We tried to use anatomical regions to define each ROI, depending on standard software and atlases in the MRI field; in one case, the parcellation software had difficulty accurately defining one ROI (vmPFC), but we chose to stay with our pre-registered choice.

Slice time correction done by AFNI's 3dTshift as setup by the tshift block in the afni_proc.py command, which uses 5th order Lagrange polynomial interpolation. This was done before motion correction.  Slice #0 was used for the reference, to keep nominal volume times in sync with stimulus timing.	"Motion correction was done using 3dvolreg using 6-parameter rigid transformations.

The reference scan is the “MIN_OUTLIER” volume (volume in the time series with fewest number of outliers detected using 3dToutcount, pre-motion correction, to minimize risk of selecting a high-motion time point). 

The similarity metric is weighted least squares, to determine the 6 rigid body motion parameters and the accompanying coordinate transformation matrix for each time point.

Interpolation type is “cubic” when determining the motion parameters.  The interpolation type of ""wsinc5"" (weighted sinc, ±5 voxel neighborhood) was applied to the EPI when the combined transformation to MNI space was applied: the EPI➝ref➝anat➝(NL)MNI template transformations were combined to allow a single interpolation from the original EPI time series to the MNI analysis space."

Here are the steps in the @SSwarper script:
  #1: Uniform-ize the T1-weighted volume intensity (3dUnifize) - skipped (already done)
  #2: Strip the skull (3dSkullStrip), with mildly aggressive settings.
  #3: Nonlinearly warp (3dQwarp) the result from #1 to the skull-on
      template, driving the warping to a medium level of refinement.
  #4: Use a slightly dilated brain mask from the template to
      crop off any non-brain tissue resulting from #3 (3dcalc).
  #5: Warp the output of #4 back to original anatomical space,
      along with the template brain mask, and combine those
      with the output of #2 to get a better skull-stripped
      result in original space (3dNwarpApply and 3dcalc).
  #6: Restart the nonlinear warping, registering the output
      of #5 to the skull-off template brain volume (3dQwarp).
  #7: Use @snapshot_volreg3 to make pretty pictures for QC.
The nonlinear warp computed in 3dQwarp (and applied to the EPI data in 3dNwarpApply) is computed incrementally using a set of overlapping 3D polynomial patches. As the patches are refined, more parameters are introduced. However, the many thousands of parameters defining the polynomial patches are not saved; rather, the warp is stored as a non-parametric displacement field in a 3-volume NiFTI datasets. Program 3dNwarpApply uses such a warp dataset to transform other 3D datasets in the same fashion (and can catenate warps and matrices on-the-fly); its default interpolation method is weighted sinc, but lower order methods are also available (e.g., NN for warping ROI labels)."	"We used AFNI's 3dUnifize for T1w intensity correction.  Command:

   	    -input  ${sid}_T1w-deobl.nii.gz   \

We ran Freesurfer with the -3T flag which runs nu intensity correction, in the creation of a white matter mask for each subject."	The “scale” block  was utilized in afni_proc.py, which scales the mean of each EPI voxel time series to 100; that is, the voxels are scaled separately, not the volumes as a whole.  The fluctuations in the resulting time series have an interpretation of local (BOLD) % signal change. Values are truncated to a range of [0,200].	"Nuisance regression was done including the motion parameters and local white matter voxelwise regressors.
The 6 rigid-body motion parameters (estimated in 3dvolreg) were included, one set of 6 per run.

Local white matter tissue signals were were included in the regression model set up by the afni_proc.py script as specified by the flags “-regress_anaticor_fast” and ""-regress_anaticor_fwhm 20”. The local signal from the eroded white matter is computed summing each EPI volume over the nearby white matter voxels weighted by a Gaussian decay, in this case with a full width half max of 20 mm (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20420926).  Each EPI voxel time series thus gets a separate ANATICOR regressor, in addition to the usual (global) motion parameter regressors. (The time series regression analysis program 3dREMLfit can deal with voxelwise regressors.)"	"Censoring is done with AFNI as part of the regress step
Criteria:
+ the Euclidean norm (enorm) of the 6 motion parameters first temporal differences is calculated, and where enorm is greater than a threshold (here, 0.3 ~mm), both that volume and the preceding one are censored.
+ the fraction of outliers in each (automasked) volume is calculated, and where the fraction is greater than a threshold (here, 0.05), that volume is censored from the regression model.
In most cases, censoring due to excessive “outliers” in a volume coincides with censoring due to excessive motion -- but not always. Both methods are used to be safe."	"No spatial smoothing was applied here during single subject processing.

Spatial smoothing was applied later (to the individual subject-level effect size estimates “betas”) as part of AFNI's ETAC form of running 3dttest++ for group analysis and clustering, where it applied several different blurs (here, 0, 4, 6, and 8mm Gaussian FWHM applied inside the brain mask using an iterative approach), before combining those results to maintain an overall FPR."

"We modelled the task using a canonical (only) basis function, AFNI's BLOCK model (an integrated gamma variate function), using response times as the individual event durations.  HRF peaks varied, according to the convolution with the response times.
We used the following independent variables:
- for trials with a response, BLOCK, with duration equal to response time, and amplitude modulation parameters (leading to automatically generated parametrically modulated regressors) for gain and loss in dollars
- for trials without a response, BLOCK, with duration of 4 s (the total period in which a subject could respond)
Nuisance regressors:
- A Gaussian weighted local neighborhood of white matter (ANATICOR), leading to 1 voxel-dependent regressor 
- Six motion parameters (degrees and mm) per run
- The baseline and temporal drift was modeled as Legendre polynomials of order 4, including 5 regressors per run.
- Generalized linear least squares (GLSQ) regression was carried out, with the temporal noise autocovariance modeled with voxelwise ARMA(1,1) parameters estimated from the GLSQ residuals at each voxel (i.e, REML)."	duration	1	"Parametric effect of gain

Parametric effect of loss"	Mass Univariate	Simple voxelwise t-tests on the parametric effects estimated for each subject at the first level analysis.	"The 9 hypotheses were evaluated with 4 group-level whole-brain two-sided t-tests and 1 between group test. The 4 whole-brain tests will be:
  - Parametric effect of gain in the equal indifference group
  - Parametric effect of gain in the equal range group
  - Parametric effect of loss in the equal indifference group
  - Parametric effect of loss in the equal range group
The between group test was a two-sided test of difference in the parametric effect of loss between the indifference group and the equal range group."	Whole brain	"Inference and multiple testing correction was carried out using AFNI’s ETAC (Equitable Thresholding And Clustering) method applied to voxelwise t-tests. This technique uses multiple in-brain Gaussian blur levels (here: 0, 4, 6, and 8 mm), and multiple voxelwise cluster forming p-thresholds (here: 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, … 0.010), producing multiple activation masks (here: 4×10=40). These masks are each clustered (here: using 18 neighbors), and then the clusters are thresholded based on mass (here: sum of voxelwise z2), with the cluster mass thresholds for each of the 40 cases adjusted simultaneously to control the estimated FWER of the union mask. As one result of the ETAC analysis, 40 cluster mass thresholds are computed for each of the 5 t-tests (e.g., at voxelwise p=0.005 and blur=4 mm). These thresholds are applied to the actual (non-permuted) t-tests at each blur level (program 3dMultiThresh) and the union of the surviving voxels from all these 40 threshold+cluster operations are the final ETAC mask delineating the regions designated as “significant”.

The FWER is estimated using 10,000 permutations of the subjects and re-running the voxelwise t-tests (for each of the 4 blurs) to produce pseudo-noise z-statistic volumes to be run through the multi-p/multi-blur thresholding process. In this study, since 5 different t-tests were made to answer the 9 given questions, the ETAC goal FWER (i.e., the global FPR) was targeted to 1%, although ETAC masks were also computed for FPR=2%, 3%, …, 9% in order to investigate any trend towards statistical significance.

The ETAC method can be thought of as being somewhat in-between standard clustering (with a single voxelwise p-threshold) and TFCE (with a large range of p-thresholds), with the addition of multiple blurring steps allowed to enable detection of regions at different spatial scales."	Voxelwise p-value computation (needed for ETAC thresholding, as described earlier) was carried out using standard t-test parametric assumptions. The ETAC permutations are used to find cluster mass thresholds.	"Please see the reply in the ""Describe inference: Statistic type"" Section, above, which contains all the relevant information."

Note that when not considering take and pass in our models, there is evidence for gain effects (see Supplementary materials, Table S5.) for the equal indifference group in both the ventral striatum and vmPFC. The reason that we say that the hypothesis is not supported is because of the significant interaction with take/pass suggesting that the effect of gain may only be present in the take condition (See Supplementary Tables S2. - S4.).

The NAcc and amygdala clusters within this mask were heavily connected with each other, the thalamus, and the anterior insulae, so isolating voxels within the NAcc and amygdala within the Kable mask was done through application of the Harvard-Oxford Subcortical probability atlas. "	Sorry for being a bit difficult but I’m unsure here whether you want software used just for preprocessing or all software used (including both preprocessing and analysis), since this question is located in the proprocessing section but there is not a similar question located in the analysis section.

NA	"Filtered_func_data from FSL (post smoothing and high-pass filtering) were submitted to AFNI’s 3dDeconvolve function. The number of time points were the same for each run for each participant, at 453. Total inputs to 3dDeconvolve included 14: 1 for trial onsets and 13 nuisance (for the 6 MCFLIRT + 6 aCompCor + 1 framewise displacement vectors). 

Trial onsets included 64 regressors, as no scrubbing was completed so all trials were kept for each run for each participant. Trial durations modeled were equal to the response times for each trial, while trial amplitudes were modeled as a constant of 1 across all trials. AFNI’s BLOCK convolution was used. The resulting trial-level beta estimates were cleaned of outliers (detailed in section titled “Independent variables – first level”). 

For the baseline (null hypothesis model), Polort was specified as 1, meaning a polynomial with a degree of 1 was used, so there were a total of 15 vectors (13 nuisance and 2 polort). "	Full brain	"Trial-level fMRI betas for each voxel were predicted by trial-level phenomena in a linear mixed effects model, with random intercepts modeled at the level of the participant. This method allows for the simultaneous estimation of both participant and group level effects, so analysis was not segmented into first and second levels.  

See “Dependent variable: Data submitted to statistical modeling” for details on how trial-level fMRI betas were calculated. 

Trial-level phenomena predicting trial-level betas included centered and scaled gain and loss magnitudes (treated as continuous variables), while for some models there was also a contrast-coded task variable to capture the two different task-types for task by magnitude interactions (also treated as a continuous variable, with the Equal Indifference and Equal Range tasks coded as 1 and -1, respectively). Given the hypotheses we were asked to test assume equal effects for take and pass judgments, we did not model take and pass judgments explicitly when identifying the ROIs associated with gain and loss. In our own work, take and pass is highly correlated with gain and loss, and this introduces collinearity in our experience in the model estimation. By only modeling gain and loss, we allowed all variance associated with these terms to be associated with gain and loss. 

Trial-level fMRI beta outliers were removed at the level of the participant. Trials which had fMRI betas that were +/- 3 standard deviations were removed from analysis. 

A second outlier removal step was also completed at the level of the model. Outliers were removed which had standardized residuals +/- 3 standard deviations. Upon removal of these outliers, a final mixed-effects regression was computed, which we then use for inference.

From these analyses, we defined regions associated with gain or loss from the main effects maps associated with gain or loss. For interpretation, we extracted the time series from these regions for further analysis. Because our work has suggested that gain and loss may have very different responses for take and pass trials, we added the additional variable of take/pass for analysis. Thus, for interpretation, we predicted activation within each ROI as [fmri ~ gain * loss * takepass * task]. Take/pass was treated as a binary variable for analysis."	duration	1	N/a, see section “Independent variables - first level”	Linear mixed-effects: LME4 as implemented in R	"To account for drift, a high pass filter of 128s was used during preprocessing, and a polort of 1 during estimation of single trial betas (see section “Dependent variable: Data submitted to statistical modeling”).

Our linear mixed-effects models were implemented with restricted maximum likelihood, using the bobyqa optimizer, t-tests were calculated using Satterthwaite's method, we used the default unstructured variance-covariance structure of R’s lme4 package."	"In total, 13 full-brain voxel-wise mixed effects regressions were completed (see Table S1.). The primary model predicted fMRI trial-level betas from gain magnitude, loss magnitude, task-type, and the interaction of all three, and included both take and pass trials (Table S1., Model 1). The remaining 12 models were for diagnostic and supplementary interpretation to assist in understanding Model 1.

To address hypotheses 1-8, we took NAcc, amygdala, and vmPFC clusters identified in the gain and loss magnitude effects maps from model 1. The identification process included full-brain FDR correction and masking (detailed below). Once we had isolated each cluster (see Figures S1-S6.), we calculated the mean trial-level beta weights within each cluster and explored the behaviour of the clusters using the fmri ~ gain * loss * takepass * task model described earlier (see Tables S2. - S5.).

To address hypothesis 9, we then took amygdala clusters in our ROIs identified in the loss * task interaction effect map from model 18. The identification process included full-brain FDR correction and masking (detailed below). Once we had isolated each cluster (see Figure S7.), we calculated the mean trial-level beta weights within each cluster and then tested the behaviour of the clusters using the fmri ~ gain * loss * takepass * task model described earlier (see Figures S8-S10).

One vmPFC ROI was defined using a single centered spherical ROI with a 9mm radius based on Clithero & Rangel, 2014 (Table 6). Another was defined using bilateral spherical ROIs with 5mm radius using coordinates from Bartra, Mcguire & Kable, 2013 (Table 3).

Additionally, trials with reaction times less than or equal to .001 seconds were considered missed trials and were thus excluded from analysis.

Full brain was modeled at the individual subject level, unmasked. 	"We modeled our first level analysis using regressors for trial onset, missed trials, and button press separately. Trial onset was additionally parametrically modulated by gain and loss and duration was set to the trial-level reaction time. Stimulus onset HRF was modeled as an event related canonical HRF with amplitude and duration modulation as described above (AFNI specifications stim_type AM2 and basis 'dmBLOCK(0)'). Missed trials and button presses HRFs were modeled using AFNI's 'GAM', which is a 12 second canonical HRF). 

Motion regressors were modeled according to demeaned motion in 6 directions: roll, pitch, yaw, dS, dL, and dP. No temporal derivitaves were used. AFNI standard mean and de-trending regressors were included for each run separately."	duration	1	"No covariates were included in these group level models. For loss ER vs EI, these two groups were modeled according to 3dMEMA two-sample t-test specifications (i.e. using -groups command). 

We had five total models to test the nine questions:
gain_ei (modeled gain vs. 0 for only participants in the equal indifference condition)
gain_er (modeled gain vs. 0 for only participants in the equal range condition)
loss_ei (modeled loss vs. 0 for only participants in the equal indifference condition)
loss_er (modeled loss vs. 0 for only participants in the equal range condition)
loss_er_vs_loss_ei (modeled as loss for the ER group vs. loss for the EI group).

The use of 3dMEMA in AFNI meant that 2nd-level analyses weighted (using the KH test) individual subjects' beta values with their individual t-statistic such that individuals with higher t-statistics were given greater voxelwise weight in the group-level analysis. "	Mass univariate. One and two-sample t-tests were modeled using AFNI '3dMEMA' specification, using mixed effects modeling. This model uses each individual subjects' REML-estimated coefficient and t-statistic.	"First level model: a spatial autocorrelation function for each subject was estimated according to mixed-model ACF specified in the blur procedure of afni_proc.py. This computes an ACF blur estimate for each subject in the x,y, and z directions that is then averaged across subjects and used for cluster extent thresholding at the group level. Standard AFNI detrending and mean regressors were included in the first-level regressions for each run. Analyses used AFNI's 3dREMLfit function, which solves linear equations for each voxel in the generalized (prewhitened) least squares sense, using the REML estimation method to find a best-fit ARMA(1,1) model.

Group level models were mixed-effects models using AFNI '3dMEMA' and individual subject's restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of task and motion regressors. For Hypothesis 9 (contrasting the ER and EI groups), equal variance was assumed. "	All contrasts were two-sided, and were simple one-sample and two-sample (independent sample) t-tests subject to the 3dMEMA mixed effects adjustments (e.g. for gain vs. 0, we examined the main effect of parametric gain on whole brain BOLD signal).	The group level models were constructed and subsequently thresholded on a whole-brain basis. These were then further masked according to anatomically defined ROIs as specified in Analysis: General (see above).	Cluster-wise statistics were extracted from the ROI-masked whole brain model. This masked whole brain model (for each ROI separately) was first cluster thresholded according to AFNI's 3dClustSim -acf specification and the mean ACF values across subjects (using an uncorrected p value of 0.001, and a cluster threshold of 52 voxels to attain a final, whole-brain corrected p-value of 0.05). AFNI's cluster report was then used to determine the presence of any clusters remaining in the specified ROI, which formed the basis for the binary Yes/No decision for each of the 9 hypotheses.	Parametric inference at the whole brain level assessed statistical significance. Using AFNI's 3dClustSim, it was determined that a p<.001 threshold with a cluster size extent of 52 voxels was equivalent to a whole-brain thresholded p-value of p < .05. Any clusters that were larger than 52 voxels in size at p<.001 in the whole brain model were considered statistically signficant. 	None. 	In addition to the whole brain models run above, we also extracted mean beta and t-values for each subject (using restricted maximum likelihood estimates) from ROI masks before they were entered into a whole brain analysis and did post-hoc tests on the resulting betas (one for each subject, for each ROI).  These tests, effectively small-volume corrected tests, identified, at the p < 0.01 level, the following answers to the 9 hypotheses: 1) No, 2) No, 3) Yes, 4) No, 5) Yes, 6) Yes, 7) No, 8), No, 9) No. We formed these binary judgments on the basis of non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

NA	108 participants were submitted to statistical modelling. Each participant had four runs of the MGT task from one session. No participants were excluded from analysis.	Full brain	"Trials were separated into ""response"" and ""no response"". Response trials were modeled with a duration equal to the trial's response time, while no response trials had durations equal to the duration of the stimulus (4 seconds). Response trials were also modeled with two parametric modulators, in addition to a ""main effect of response"" regressor. In the ""main effect of response"" regressor, onsets and durations of response trials were convolved with a canonical SPM HRF, with no amplitude modulation. In the first parametric modulator regressor, response*response, participant responses (""strongly reject"", ""weakly reject"", ""weakly accept"", and ""strongly accept"") were coded as numerical values (0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively). In order to orthogonalize the response*response regressor, the participant response values were also mean-centered and variance-normalized, and were included as amplitude modulators, prior to convolution with a canonical SPM HRF. The second parametric modulator depended on the model.

Two models were fitted for each participant: one for gain and one for loss. For the gain model, gain values for response trials were used to modulate amplitude of the response*gain parametrically modulator regressor, after mean-centering and variance-normalization. For the loss trials, the same procedure was performed for loss values and a response*loss regressor was included in the model. This resulted in three to four task regressors for each model: ""main effect of response"", ""response*response"", ""response*gain"" or ""response*loss"", and sometimes ""no response"".

A cosine drift model was used for high-pass filtering with a cutoff of 128 seconds, which resulted in six drift regressors included in each model. Other nuisance regressors included in the model were: six translational and rotational motion parameters, their temporal derivatives, and censored volumes indicating high motion, proximity to high motion, or non-steady state. An AR(1) autocorrelation model was also included in the models. No orthogonalization was applied to any task or nuisance regressors.

Run-level models were fitted for each run and then combined across runs, per participant, with a fixed-effects model (i.e.,an average) combining parameter estimates for the response*gain and response*loss regressors across runs.   "	duration	1	Group-level modeling was performed using separate GLMs for gain and loss conditions, assessing within- and between-group effects separately for each condition using response*gain and response*loss parameter estimates per subject, respectively. For each gain and loss models, subjects' group membership (i.e., equal range or equal indifference groups) was included as regressors in the design matrix and group-level brain activation during gain and loss were modeled as main effects of these regressors. Subject effects (age, sex, and average framewise displacement across both runs) were mean centered and included as regressors, though not split by group. Subject effects were not explicitly modeled as contrasts, simply included as regressors of no interest to control for age, sex, and head movement within the scanner. Positive effects of gain for each the equal range and equal indifference groups were modeled with one-tailed permutation tests, using contrasts that isolated the main positive effects of each group. Positive and negative effects of loss for each of the equal range and equal indifference groups were modeled with one-tailed permutation tests, as well, using contrasts that isolated the main negative effects of each group. Group differences in the positive effect of loss were modeled with one-tail permutation tests that compared the main effects of the two groups in each direction (i.e., equal range > equal indifference and equal indifference > equal range), though only the greater positive effects of loss in the equal range than equal indifference group were considered. 	Mass Univariate	We performed mass-univariate group-level random effects models with ordinary least squares regression as implemented in FSL's Randomise, a non-parametric permutation method, and did not otherwise assume or define any specific variance structure. 	Brain activation during gain and loss trials within each group were determined via contrasts that isolated the main effect of group (i.e., equal range or equal indifference) to each gain and loss, separately. Here, we assessed, via one-tailed tests thresholded at alpha < 0.005,  the positive effect of gain, the positive effect of loss, and the negative effect of loss within each group. We assessed, too, the difference in the positive effect of loss between the two groups (both equal range > equal indifference and equal indifference > equal range, though only the former was considered in the results).   	Whole brain	Cluster size thresholding was used, with a cluster-forming threshold of t = 2.6896 and a neighborhood size of 26 voxels.	P-values were calculated for each contrast and corrected for Familywise error using a permutation approach via FSL's Randomise tool, with 10,000 permutations per contrast.

The 3 parametric regressors are orthogonalized using the default settings in SPM. To make the analysis explicit, we only use the canonical HRF basis. Additionally, we also include the 6 regressors for the head movements in the general linear model. Notably, in order to make it intuitive to calculate the expected value (EV) and expected utility (EU), we include the negative values for the loss regressor instead of the absolute values in the raw behavioral data, so the activation we observe in the T map (see NeuroValult link for details) at the 2nd level for loss regressor might be just symmetrically opposite from the hypothesis on the NARPS website which should be consistent with the definition in Tom (2007). 
For the brain activations derived from the 2nd level analysis, in general, we report the results that satisfy the criteria of P value equals to 0.005 with a cluster-wise neighborhood size larger than 10 without multiple comparison correction. We understand that this is not a strict standard, but as we have the prior hypothesis for the potential regions that might be involved in the process of gain and loss in these two mixed gamble tasks based on the previous literature, it should be fine to check the data with the region of interest analysis (ROI) analysis or small volume correction (SVC) focusing on these specific brain regions only. Due to the time constraints, so far, we just got the results for the whole brain analysis, so we answer the 9 questions of YES OR NO based on the results with this loose p value of 0.005. Frankly speaking, this is also part of the reason that the activation seems not very strong for the parametric gains and losses in general, especially for the equal range group although the activation for the categorical onsets seems strong enough (activation of the Salience Network and deactivation of the Default Mode Network, data is available upon request) for both groups given the medium sample size in the current project.     "	No	NA	"As explained above, this is a pre-hypothesized study, it should be appropriate to use the ROI analysis or SVC with the correction p value of 0.05. Due to the time constraint, so far we only have the results at the whole brain level and the results seems not very strong especially for the group with equal range, so we choose a loose criteria of p value of 0.005 to make the standard uniform across all the hypothesis testing. In addition to that, in order to calculate the expected value (EV) and expected utility (EU) for each gamble, so we encode the loss into negative values instead of the absolute values in the original behavioural data. Therefore, the T map results should be understood in a opposite manner to check whether it’s consistent with the original hypothesis or not.

For the second-level analyses, we first smoothed the contrasts from the first-level using a Gaussian kernel (spm_smooth.m) with FWHM of 8mm. We then computed unweighted summary statistics. Effectively our approach to the second level is to pool the subject-level contrasts for the parametric coefficient estimates at the first level, and then to compute unweighted means of the coefficient estimates.   	For each hypothesis tested, we computed simple t-statistics in each voxel using the estimated coefficients from the gain (or loss) values shown to each subject in each run (4 coefficients estimated for gains per subject, one per run; the same for losses). For the hypotheses involving particular subject groups, we restricted the sample to either the Equal Indifference or Equal Range groups. 	All inferences used whole brain (FWE-corrected) analyses.

Hypthesis 2: As above, we observed a significant medial frontal cluster, however this was more superior, localised more to dorsal anterior cingulate and medial superior frontal cortex. The lowest Z-co-ordinate for local peaks within this cluster was 32.

Hypothesis 3 & 4: The implicit mask generated in group-level statistical analysis excluded significant portions of this area, hence we cannot be confident in our findings for these regions.

Hypothesis 5: A significant cluster of 288 voxels (peak MNI co-ordinates: -10, 60, -8) was observed. Anatomical labeling of the cluster using AAL2 indicated the majority of the cluster was located within bilateral medial orbital frontal gyrus and rectus. 

Hypothesis 6: A significant cluster of 94 voxels (peak MNI co-ordinates: -10, 46, -12) was observed. Anatomical labeling of the cluster using AAL2 indicated the cluster was located within bilateral medial orbital frontal gyrus and rectus. 

Hypothesis 7: Significant positive effect of loss was observed in 9 clusters, including bilateral Insula cortex, bilateral occipital clusters, supplementary motor area and a left parietal region. No signifcant clusters encompassing amygdala were observed.

Hypothesis 8: Significant positive effect of loss was observed in 16 clusters, including bilateral Insula cortex, bilateral occipital clusters, supplementary motor area and parietal regions. No signifcant clusters encompassing amygdala were observed.  

Hypothesis 9: Four clusters showed greater positive response to loss in the equal range group compared to the equal indifference condition. Two clusters in right frontal regions and bilateral inferior parietal regions showed this group difference in positive parametric response to loss. No effect was observed in amygdala.

Additionally, the bias field and brain extracted bias corrected T1 were saved.	No slice-timing correction was performed	Motion correction was performed with reference to the single band reference image using 'mcflirt' from FSL. 		No gradient distortion correction was performed.	EPIs were coregistered to T1 structural image by initially creating warp fields with 'epi_reg' from FSL. This process utilised brain-extracted, bias field corrected T1 image that was computed during brain extraction step in addition to the original T1 (both resampled to 2mm isotropic voxels using linear interpolation with ANTs 'ResampleImage'), a white matter image that was obtained during segmentation then binarised (threshold = 0.9) with 'fslmaths', a field map in radians computed using 'fsl_prepare_fieldmap', and both a the original magnitude field map image and a brain extracted version computed with the same aforementioned T1 brain extraction method.  The warps were then applied to the EPI time-series using 'applywarps' from FSL using spline interpolation.     	Susceptibility distortion correction of the EPI time-series was conducted as part of the 'epi_reg' routine described above.	Warp fields describing the transformation of the bias corrected T1 image to the 2mm MNI template space supplied with FSL was determined using the default transformation option ('s') for ANTs' non-linear registration tool 'antsRegistrationSyn.sh'. This tool includes rigid, affine and diffeomorphic symmetric registration processes. The warp fields generated during this process  were then applied to T1 data with 'antsApplyTransforms'. Subsequently, these warp fields were applied to coregistered EPI data. Note the time-series were first split using 'fslsplit' into 3D volumes and the warps applied to individual images - we could not get the ANTs routine to work on a 4D dataset; after normalisation of the time-series, 'fslmerge' was used to concatenate the data into a 4D file for each run. 	A bias field corrected T1 image was computed during  brain extraction.	First level modelling was performed using SPM12, hence each run was scaled such that the mean image had a mean intra-cerebral intensity of 100.	We applied ICA-AROMA to EPI time-series after spatial smoothing using the 'non-aggressive' algorithm setting. We also concatenated motion-related noise regressors to be included as covariates in first level imodels, including the motion parameters computed by mcflirt, and their first temporal derivative that was computed using the central difference method.	We used ART tools (within the CONN for connectivity toolbox) to compute EPI volume outliers. An image was deemed an outlier if it was >3 standard deviations from the time-series mean (within run) or exhibited > 2mm framewise displacement. One regressor was created for each outlier with a '1' flagging the outlier and '0' identifiying each other time-series image.	Spatial smoothing was applied using a 5mm FWHM kernel (kernel divided by sigma where 2.3548) within fslmaths.	Data were always written using float datatype precision.	As detailed above, four participants with >10% of volumes exceeding criteria for outlier scrubbing were excluded from final analysis.	Full brain 	At the first level of analysis, effects of interest (Gain and Loss effects) were assessed in separate event-related models. Each model included an 'All Trials' regressor that coded the onsets of all trials with 4 second durations, and incorporated three linear parametric modulation regressors. The first regressor modelled trial decision responses, either 'accept'  (coded as '1s') and 'reject' (coded as '-1s') responses and the second parametric modulation regressor modelled 'expected value' (as defined in Canessa et al., 2013). In the 'Gain' model, the third regressor modelled 'Gain' amounts for each mixed gamble trial, whereas in the 'Loss' model, loss  amounts were coded for each mixed gamble trial. Covariates of no interest included the motion-related noise and volume censoring regressors in both models. Slow signal drift was removed using 1/128 Hz high-pass filter, and serial correlations in the timeseries accounted for using an AR(1) model during (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) parameter estimation. Contrast images depicting the linear effect of Gain and Loss were computed using one sample t-tests on the gain and loss regressor for the respective models. Note that SPM12 orthogonalises parametric modulation regressors such that any shared variance between regressors is attributed to the first regressor modelled. Gain and Loss contrast images were entered into second level models as appropriate.  	none	0	Contrast images assessing the linear effect of Gain and Loss were entered into second level random effects models as implemented in SPM12. Each directional hypothesis was assessed using a one-sided T-test. For hypotheses 1-8, this comprised one-sample T-tests, with one model using the Gain contrast image for those in the equal indifference group (hypotheses 1 & 3), another the Gain contrast image for the equal range group (hypotheses 2 & 4), another the Loss contrast images for the those in the equal indifference group (hypotheses 5 & 7), and a model for the Loss contrast image for the equal range group (hypotheses 6 & 8). Similarly, hypothesis 9 was assessed by a entering the Loss contrast for the two groups into a two-sample T-test, with one-sided contrast used to assess equal range > equal indifference conditions. 	Mass Univariate	As above, SPM defaults: global approximate AR(1) (first level); Random effects, Ordinary Least Squares. 	One-sided contrasts were used to assess each hypothesis within the one-sample T-test (hypotheses 1-8) and two-sample T-tests (hypothesis 9).	Regional hypotheses were masked using anatomical Regions of Interest, derived from the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas (version 2) as described above. Correction for multiple comparisons was conducted at the whole brain level.	As implemented in SPM, cluster extent based thresholding was used, with a voxel-wise cluster-defining threshold of p<.001. 	Standard parametric inference	Cluster-level FWE corrected p<.05 was used for all hypothesis testing, using Random Field Theory, as implemented in SPM.
