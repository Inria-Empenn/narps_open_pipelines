# How to contribute to NARPS Open Pipelines ? 

General guidelines can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) in the GitHub documentation. 

## Reproduce a pipeline :keyboard:
:thinking: Not sure which one to start with ? You can have a look on [this table](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/wiki/pipeline_status) giving the work progress status for each pipeline. This will help choosing the one that best suits you!

Need more information ? You can have a look to the pipeline description [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FU_F6kdxOD4PRQDIHXGHS4zTi_jEVaUqY_Zwg0z6S64/edit?usp=sharing). Also feel free to use the `narps_open.utils.description` module of the project, as described [in the documentation](/docs/description.md).

When you are ready, [start an issue](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/issues/new/choose) and choose **Pipeline reproduction**!

### If you have experience with NiPype

We created templates with modifications to make and holes to fill to create a pipeline. You can find them in [`narps_open/pipelines/templates`](/narps_open/pipelines/templates).

If you feel it could be better explained, do not hesitate to suggest modifications for the templates.

Feel free to have a look to the following pipelines, these are examples :
| team_id | softwares | fmriprep used ? | pipeline file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2T6S | SPM | Yes | [/narps_open/pipelines/team_2T6S.py](/narps_open/pipelines/team_2T6S.py) |
| X19V | FSL | Yes | [/narps_open/pipelines/team_X19V.py](/narps_open/pipelines/team_2T6S.py) |

### If you have experience with the original software package but not with NiPype

A fantastic tool named [Giraffe](https://giraffe.tools/porcupine/TimVanMourik/GiraffePlayground/master) is available. It allows you to create a graph of your pipeline using NiPype functions but without coding! Just save your NiPype script in a .py file and send it as a new issue, we will convert this script to a script which works with our specific parameters.
