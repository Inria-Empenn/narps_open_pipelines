# How to contribute to NARPS Open Pipelines ? 

For the reproductions, we are especially looking for contributors with the following profiles:
 - üë©‚Äçüé§ SPM, FSL, AFNI or nistats has no secrets for you? You know this fMRI analysis software by heart üíì. Please help us by reproducing the corresponding NARPS pipelines. üë£ after step 1, follow the fMRI expert trail.
 - üßë‚Äçüé§ You are a nipype guru? üë£ after step 1, follow the nipype expert trail.

# Step 1: Choose a pipeline to reproduce :keyboard:
:thinking: Not sure which pipeline to start with ? üö¶The [pipeline dashboard](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/wiki/pipeline_status) provides the progress status for each pipeline. You can pick any pipeline that is in red (not started).

Need more information to make a decision? The `narps_open.utils.description` module of the project, as described [in the documentation](/docs/description.md) provides easy access to all the info we have on each pipeline.

When you are ready, [start an issue](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/issues/new/choose) and choose **Pipeline reproduction**!

# Step 2: Reproduction 

## üßë‚Äçüé§ NiPype trail

We created templates with modifications to make and holes to fill to create a pipeline. You can find them in [`narps_open/pipelines/templates`](/narps_open/pipelines/templates).

If you feel it could be better explained, do not hesitate to suggest modifications for the templates.

Feel free to have a look to the following pipelines, these are examples :
| team_id | softwares | fmriprep used ? | pipeline file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2T6S | SPM | Yes | [/narps_open/pipelines/team_2T6S.py](/narps_open/pipelines/team_2T6S.py) |
| X19V | FSL | Yes | [/narps_open/pipelines/team_X19V.py](/narps_open/pipelines/team_X19V.py) |

## üë©‚Äçüé§ fMRI software trail

From the description provided by the team you chose, perform the analysis on the associated software to get as many metadata (log, configuration files, and other relevant files for reproducibility) as possible from the execution. Complementary hints on the process would definitely be welcome, to enrich the description.

Especially these files contain valuable information about model design:
* for FSL pipelines, `design.fsf` setup files coming from FEAT ;
* for SPM pipelines, matlabbatch files.

## Find or propose an issue :clipboard:
Issues are very important for this project. If you want to contribute, you can either **comment an existing issue** or **proposing a new issue**.

## Pull Requests :inbox_tray:
Pull requests are the best way to get your ideas into this repository and to solve the problems as fast as possible.

### Make A Branch :deciduous_tree:
Create a separate branch for each issue you're working on. Do not make changes to the default branch (e.g. master, develop) of your fork.

### Push Your Code :outbox_tray:
Push your code as soon as possible.

### Create the Pull Request (PR) :inbox_tray:
Once you pushed your first lines of code to the branch in your fork, visit [this page](https://github.com/Inria-Empenn/narps_open_pipelines/pulls) to start creating a PR for the NARPS Open Pipelines project.

:warning: Please create a **Draft Pull Request** as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork), and please stick to the PR description template as much as possible.

Continue writing your code and push to the same branch. Make sure you perform all the items of the PR checklist.

### Request Review :disguised_face:
Once your PR is ready, you may add a reviewer to your PR, as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) in the GitHub documentation.

Please turn your Draft Pull Request into a "regular" Pull Request, by clicking **Ready for review** in the Pull Request page.
