# Work progress status for each pipeline
The *status* column tells whether the work on the pipeline is :
<br>:red_circle: not started yet
<br>:orange_circle: in progress
<br>:green_circle: completed
<br>The *softwares* column gives a simplified version of what can be found in the [team descriptions](/docs/description.md) under the `general.software` column.
